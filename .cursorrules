# Instructions

You are an expert TypeScript/Next.js developer focused on writing clean, maintainable code. Prioritize these qualities:

1. **Minimal** - Absolute minimum code needed
2. **Self-documenting** - Code explains itself through:
   - Precise naming (verbs for functions, nouns for variables)
   - Single-responsibility components
   - Obvious data flow
   - Add short comments when necessary
3. **Type-Exact** - Strict TypeScript types with zero 'any'
4. **Secure** - Built-in security for auth/data handling
5. **Performant** - Follows Next.js optimization guides

Before coding, make a plan inside a <thinking> tag.

1. Identify core requirement
2. Consider 3 implementation approaches
3. Choose simplest that meets needs
4. Verify with these questions:
   - Can this be split into smaller functions?
   - Are there unnecessary abstractions?
   - Will this be clear to a junior dev?

For example:
<thinking>
Let me think through this step by step.
...
</thinking>

Good vs Bad code examples:

```typescript
// Bad
const processData = (input: unknown) => {
  /* ... */
};

// Good
const formatUserDisplayName = (user: User): string => {
  // Combines first/last names with fallback to email
  return (
    [user.firstName, user.lastName].filter(Boolean).join(" ") || user.email
  );
};
```

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again.

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have a python venv in ./venv. Use it.
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.
- Keep all files under 100 lines of code to maintain readability and follow single responsibility principle
- Split hooks/components when they grow too large or handle multiple concerns

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities
- When using TurboFactory from @ardrive/turbo-sdk, the fileStreamFactory must return a Web API compatible ReadableStream from node:stream/web, not Node.js streams
- For logging in production code, use template literals with specific identifiers (e.g. handle, artistId) to make debugging easier
- When handling image uploads, implement proper fallback mechanisms and clear error messages

## Current Task: Fix Zero Segments Issue After Funnel Completion

### Problem Analysis

The issue where segments show as zero immediately after funnel completion but appear correctly after a page refresh appears to be related to the data flow and state management between the funnel completion and segments display.

### Current Implementation

1. Data Flow:

   - Funnel completion triggers in `CompletedAnalysis.tsx`
   - Segments are fetched using `useArtistSegments` hook
   - Hook uses React Query to fetch from `/api/segments` endpoint
   - Segments data comes from `artist_segments` and `fan_segments` tables

2. Key Components:

   - `useFunnelAnalysis.tsx`: Main hook managing funnel state
   - `useArtistSegments.ts`: Hook for fetching segments data
   - `CompletedAnalysis.tsx`: Component showing completion state
   - `getArtistSegments.ts`: Backend function getting segment data

3. Potential Issues Found:
   - Race condition between funnel completion and segments data being available
   - No explicit refetch trigger after funnel completion
   - Stale time in React Query might prevent immediate refetch
   - Segments might not be immediately available in database after funnel completion

### Investigation Steps

1. [x] Review data flow:

   - Funnel completion -> Database update -> Segments fetch
   - Found potential timing issue between these steps

2. [x] Analyze React Query configuration:

   - Current staleTime: 5 minutes
   - No explicit refetch on funnel completion
   - May need to invalidate query after funnel completion

3. [x] Check database operations:

   - Segments are stored in `artist_segments` and `fan_segments`
   - Need to verify timing of segment creation vs fetch

4. [ ] Identify fix approach:
   - Options:
     a) Add explicit query invalidation after funnel completion
     b) Reduce staleTime in React Query
     c) Add polling until segments are available
     d) Add webhook/callback when segments are ready

### Next Steps

1. [ ] Implement fix:

   - Add query invalidation in `useFunnelAnalysis.tsx`
   - Update React Query configuration
   - Add proper loading states

2. [ ] Test changes:

   - Verify segments appear immediately
   - Check loading states
   - Ensure no regression in other functionality

3. [ ] Document solution:
   - Update comments
   - Add error handling
   - Document the fix in code

### Progress

✓ Analyzed current implementation
✓ Identified potential causes
✓ Found React Query configuration issue
[ ] Implement fix

## Current Task: Fix Zero Segments Issue After Funnel Completion - Debugging Strategy

### Logging Plan

1. Frontend State Tracking:

   ```typescript
   // In useFunnelAnalysis.tsx
   console.log("[Funnel Analysis] Status:", {
     isFinishedScraping: isFinishedScraping(status),
     agentStatus: status,
     selectedArtistId: selectedArtist?.account_id,
     hasSegments: segments?.length,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });
   ```

2. Query Invalidation Tracking:

   ```typescript
   // In useFunnelAnalysis.tsx before invalidation
   console.log("[Query Invalidation] Attempting:", {
     artistId: selectedArtist?.account_id,
     queryKey: ["segments", selectedArtist?.account_id],
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });

   // After invalidation
   console.log("[Query Invalidation] Complete");
   ```

3. Segments API Endpoint:

   ```typescript
   // In /api/segments/route.ts
   console.log("[Segments API] Request:", {
     artistId,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });

   // After DB query
   console.log("[Segments API] Response:", {
     segmentsCount: segments.length,
     segments: segments.map((s) => ({ id: s.id, name: s.name, size: s.size })),
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });
   ```

4. Database Query Logging:

   ```typescript
   // In getArtistSegments.ts
   console.log("[DB Query] Fetching segments:", {
     artistId,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });

   // After each supabase query
   console.log("[DB Query] Results:", {
     artistSegmentsCount: segments.length,
     segmentIds,
     fanCounts: counts,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });
   ```

5. React Query State:
   ```typescript
   // In useArtistSegments.ts
   console.log("[React Query] Hook state:", {
     artistId,
     isFetching: query.isFetching,
     isStale: query.isStale,
     dataUpdatedAt: query.dataUpdatedAt,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });
   ```

### Expected Log Flow

1. Funnel completion detected
2. Query invalidation triggered
3. New API request made
4. Database queries executed
5. Data returned to frontend
6. Component re-rendered with new data

### Key Questions to Answer Through Logs

1. Is the funnel completion being detected correctly?
2. Is query invalidation actually triggering a new fetch?
3. Is the API endpoint being called with correct artistId?
4. Are the database queries returning expected results?
5. Is the data making it back to the frontend components?
6. Is there a timing issue between state updates?

## Current Task: Fix Zero Segments Issue - Initial Load vs Refresh Analysis

### Observed Behavior

1. Initial Load:

   - ✅ Follower count correct (522)
   - ❌ Number of segments incorrect (shows 0)
   - ❌ No segments displayed

2. After Refresh:
   - ✅ Follower count still correct (522)
   - ✅ Number of segments correct (shows 3)
   - ✅ Segments displayed correctly

### Component Data Flow Analysis

1. Data Sources:

   - Follower count: Comes from `selectedArtist` via `getAggregatedSocialProfiles`
   - Segments count: Comes from `segments` array length in `CompletedAnalysis`
   - Segments data: Fetched via `useArtistSegments` hook

2. Potential Race Conditions:

   ```typescript
   // In CompletedAnalysis.tsx
   const { segments, funnelName, isLoadingSegments, isLoadingAgent } =
     useFunnelAnalysisProvider();

   // In useFunnelAnalysis.tsx
   const { data: segments } = useArtistSegments(selectedArtist?.account_id);
   if (segments) {
     params.setSegments(segments);
   }
   ```

3. State Management Issues:
   - `selectedArtist` is available immediately (explains correct follower count)
   - `segments` state is being set after async operations
   - React Query cache might be empty on initial load
   - Local state might be updated before data is available

### Hypothesis

The issue likely stems from component mounting order and state updates:

1. Initial Load Sequence:

   ```
   1. CompletedAnalysis mounts
   2. useFunnelAnalysisProvider returns initial empty segments []
   3. UI renders with segments.length = 0
   4. useArtistSegments fetches data asynchronously
   5. Data arrives but component already rendered
   ```

2. Refresh Sequence:
   ```
   1. React Query cache has data
   2. CompletedAnalysis mounts
   3. useArtistSegments returns cached data immediately
   4. UI renders with correct segments
   ```

### Investigation Focus

1. Component Mounting:

   ```typescript
   // Key points to log
   console.log("[CompletedAnalysis] Mount:", {
     hasSegments: segments?.length > 0,
     isLoading: isLoadingSegments || isLoadingAgent,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });
   ```

2. State Updates:

   ```typescript
   // Track when segments state changes
   useEffect(() => {
     console.log("[Segments] State Updated:", {
       segmentsLength: segments?.length,
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
     });
   }, [segments]);
   ```

3. Data Availability:
   ```typescript
   // In useArtistSegments
   console.log("[ArtistSegments] Data:", {
     isFetching,
     isLoading,
     dataUpdatedAt,
     hasData: !!data,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
   });
   ```

### Potential Solutions to Explore

1. Defer Rendering:

   ```typescript
   // Wait for both loading states to be false
   if (isLoadingSegments || isLoadingAgent) {
     return <SegmentsSkeleton />;
   }
   ```

2. Use Suspense Boundary:

   ```typescript
   <Suspense fallback={<SegmentsSkeleton />}>
     <SegmentsContent />
   </Suspense>
   ```

3. Ensure State Sync:
   ```typescript
   // Make sure segments state is updated when data changes
   useEffect(() => {
     if (data) {
       setSegments(data);
     }
   }, [data]);
   ```

### Next Steps

1. [ ] Add component mounting logs
2. [ ] Add state update tracking
3. [ ] Add data availability logs
4. [ ] Verify loading states are working correctly
5. [ ] Test proposed solutions

### Progress

✓ Identified different behavior between initial load and refresh
✓ Analyzed component data flow
✓ Created hypotheses about cause
[ ] Implement logging
[ ] Test solutions

## Current Task: Fix Zero Segments Issue - Log Analysis

### Key Findings from Logs

1. Data Flow Timeline:

   ```
   1. [CompletedAnalysis] Mount:
      - hasSegments: false
      - segmentsLength: 0
      - isLoading: true
      - isLoadingSegments: true
      - isLoadingAgent: false

   2. [ArtistSegments] Query State:
      - isFetching: true
      - isLoading: false
      - isStale: true
      - dataUpdatedAt exists (indicating previous data)

   3. [ArtistSegments] Fetched:
      - segmentsCount: 5
      - segments: Array(5) with valid data

   4. [CompletedAnalysis] Segments Updated:
      - hasSegments: false  // <-- Key Issue
      - segmentsLength: 0   // <-- Key Issue
      - isLoading: false
   ```

2. Critical Issue Identified:

   - The API successfully returns segments (5 segments in the response)
   - React Query successfully receives and caches the data
   - BUT: The segments state in CompletedAnalysis remains 0 despite successful data fetch

3. State Management Problem:

   ```typescript
   // In useFunnelAnalysis.tsx
   if (segments) {
     params.setSegments(segments); // This update isn't working correctly
   }
   ```

   - The segments data is not being properly propagated from React Query to the component state
   - The local state update in useFunnelAnalysis isn't triggering a re-render with new data

4. Root Cause:
   - The issue is NOT with data fetching (API returns correct data)
   - The issue is NOT with React Query (cache works, shown by refresh working)
   - The issue IS with state synchronization between:
     a) React Query's cached data
     b) useFunnelAnalysis local state
     c) CompletedAnalysis component state

### Solution Direction

1. State Synchronization Fix:

   ```typescript
   // Current problematic flow:
   React Query Cache -> useFunnelAnalysis state -> CompletedAnalysis

   // Need to either:
   a) Use React Query data directly in CompletedAnalysis
   b) Ensure proper state updates in useFunnelAnalysis
   ```

2. Proposed Fix:
   - Remove intermediate state in useFunnelAnalysis
   - Have CompletedAnalysis use React Query data directly
   - OR: Add proper useEffect for state synchronization

### Next Steps

1. [ ] Modify CompletedAnalysis to use React Query data directly
2. [ ] Remove redundant state management in useFunnelAnalysis
3. [ ] Add proper loading states during initial data fetch

### Progress

✓ Identified exact point of failure (state sync issue)
✓ Confirmed API and caching working correctly
✓ Found root cause in state management
[ ] Implement state management fix

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the [scratchpad.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/scratchpad.mdc) file so you will not make the same mistake again.

# Lessons

## User Specified Lessons

- You have an env in ./.env Use it.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- Keep all files under 100 lines of code to maintain readability and follow single responsibility principle
- Split hooks/components when they grow too large or handle multiple concerns
    
## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- When implementing file uploads:

  - Always validate response types and add proper error handling
  - Add progress tracking, size validation, and retry logic
  - Use shared utilities for common operations to maintain consistency
  - Consider adding progress tracking and retry logic
  - When using Node.js SDKs in Next.js:
    - Check for Node.js specific dependencies
    - Use separate client/server implementations
    - Watch for logger and file system dependencies
    - Properly type ReadableStreams for web environment
    - Keep authenticated clients at module level for efficiency
    - Remove duplicate code and types when possible
    - Maintain consistent error handling patterns

You should use the [scratchpad.md](mdc:scratchpad.md) file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

# Current Task: Create HideButton Component with TimelineMoment Input Type

## Task Explanation
Fix the HideButton component to use the correct TimelineMoment input type from useTimelineApi by:
1. Creating the useTimelineApi hook with TimelineMoment type definition
2. Creating/updating the HideButton component to accept TimelineMoment instead of Moment
3. Ensuring proper TypeScript typing and integration

## Task Progress
[X] Explore workspace structure and search for existing components
[X] Confirm that HideButton, TimelineMoment, and useTimelineApi don't exist yet
[X] Create TimelineMoment type definition
[X] Create useTimelineApi hook
[X] Create HideButton component with proper TimelineMoment input type
[X] Fix TypeScript compilation issues
[X] Validate implementation follows project patterns

## Findings:
- HideButton component does not exist in current codebase
- TimelineMoment type does not exist in current codebase
- useTimelineApi hook does not exist in current codebase
- Need to create all components from scratch following project patterns
- Should follow existing component patterns (Button, EditButton, etc.)
- Should follow existing hook patterns (useArtistPosts, useArtistFans, etc.)
- Should maintain TypeScript typing consistency

## Completed Implementation:
1. ✅ Created `types/Timeline.ts` with TimelineMoment interface and related types
2. ✅ Created `hooks/useTimelineApi.ts` with proper React Query integration
3. ✅ Created `components/HideButton.tsx` that accepts TimelineMoment input type
4. ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation issues and followed project patterns
5. ✅ Component includes proper error handling, loading states, and accessibility

## Files Created:
- `types/Timeline.ts` - TimelineMoment interface with metadata for visibility control
- `hooks/useTimelineApi.ts` - Hook for fetching timeline data with proper typing
- `components/HideButton.tsx` - Button component that accepts TimelineMoment and toggles visibility

## Key Features:
- HideButton now correctly accepts TimelineMoment input type (instead of Moment)
- Includes proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Follows existing component patterns (tooltips, loading states, accessibility)
- Integrates with project's React Query setup
- Includes visibility toggle functionality with API integration

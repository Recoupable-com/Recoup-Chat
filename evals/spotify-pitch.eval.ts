/**
 * Spotify Pitch Tool Usage Evaluation
 *
 * This evaluation tests whether the AI properly uses tools when asked to craft
 * Spotify-related pitches and strategies. The AI should:
 * 1. Search for Spotify for Artists requirements and playlist submission guidelines
 * 2. Use Spotify tools to get artist/album/track/playlist data
 * 3. Ask clarifying questions if needed
 * 4. NOT just respond without gathering data first
 *
 * Test cases:
 * - "Craft a Spotify for Artists pitch" - Should use Spotify tools to gather album/track data
 * - "Research playlists and curators" - Should search for playlists and analyze requirements
 *
 * Required Tools: search_web, web_deep_research, get_spotify_search, get_spotify_artist_top_tracks, get_spotify_artist_albums
 *
 * Run: npx braintrust eval evals/spotify-pitch.eval.ts

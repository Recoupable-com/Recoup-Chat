    You are assessing a submitted answer on a given task based on a criterion. Here is the data:
    [BEGIN DATA]
    ***
    [Task]: {input}
    ***
    [Submission]: {completion}
    ***
    [Criterion]: {criteria}
    ***
    [END DATA]
    Does the submission meet the criterion? 
    IMPORTANT: REPEAT submission sentence in the format [Submission]: {submission raw sentence} and then follow the steps below!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    And then write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Then print only the single character "Y" or "N" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. At the end, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line.

    Reasoning:
  eval_type: cot_classify
  choice_scores:
    "Y": 1.0
    "N": 0.0
  choice_strings: 'YN'
  input_outputs:
    input: "completion"

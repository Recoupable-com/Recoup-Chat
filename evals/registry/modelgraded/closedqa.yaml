    Does the submission meet the criterion?
    Criterion Answer Format:
      - IMPORTANT: IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THIS LINE IS INCLUDED ABSOLUTELY WITH YOUR REASONING - REPEAT THE SUBMISSION SENTENCE in the format [SUBMISSION]: ....submission text....
      - Then write out in a step-by-step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. 
      - At the end, print only the single character "Y" or "N" (without quotes or punctuation) on its own line corresponding to the correct answer. 
      - Finally, repeat just the letter again by itself on a new line.

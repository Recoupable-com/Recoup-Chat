{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: INCREASES FUNDING SOURCES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES BY CHANGING TAX ASSESSMENT OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT \n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\nThe text of this measure can be found on the Secretary of State's website at voterguide.sos.ca.gov. \u2022 Increases funding sources for K-12 public schools, community colleges, and local governments by requiring commercial and industrial real property be taxed based on current market value, instead of purchase price. \u2022 Exempts from taxation changes: residential properties; agricultural land; and owners of commercial and industrial properties with combined value of $3 million or less. Any additional education funding will supplement existing school funding guarantees. \u2022 Exempts small businesses from personal property tax; for other businesses, provides $500,000 exemption. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 Increased property taxes on commercial properties worth more than $3 million providing $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion in new funding to local governments and schools.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nLocal Governments Tax Property. California cities, counties, schools, and special districts (such as a fire protection district) collect property taxes from property owners based on the value of their property. Property taxes raise around $65 billion each year for these local governments. Overall, about 60 percent of property taxes go to cities, counties, and special districts. The other 40 percent goes to schools and community colleges. These shares are different in different counties. \n\nProperty Includes Land, Buildings, Machinery, and Equipment. Property taxes apply to many kinds of property. Land and buildings are taxed. Businesses also pay property taxes on most other things they own. This includes equipment, machinery, computers, and furniture. We call these things \"business equipment.\" \n\nHow Is a Property Tax Bill Calculated? Each property owner's annual property tax bill is equal to the taxable value of their property multiplied by their property tax rate. The typical property owner's property tax rate is 1.1 percent. \n\nTaxable Value of Land and Buildings Is Based on Original Purchase Price. In the year a piece of land or a building is purchased, its taxable value typically is its purchase price. Each year after that, the property's taxable value is adjusted for inflation by up to 2 percent. When a property is sold again, its taxable value is reset to its new purchase price. The taxable value of most land and buildings is less than what they could be sold for. This is because the price most properties could be sold for grows faster than 2 percent per year. \n\nTaxable Value of Business Equipment Is Based on How Much It Could Be Sold for. Unlike land and buildings, business equipment is taxed based on how much it could be sold for today. \n\nCounties Manage the Property Tax. County assessors determine the taxable value of property. County tax collectors bill property owners. County auditors distribute tax revenue to local governments. Statewide, counties spend about $800 million each year on these activities. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nTax Commercial and Industrial Land and Buildings Based on How Much They Could Be Sold for. The measure requires commercial and industrial (after this referred to simply as \"commercial\") land and buildings to be taxed based on how much they could be sold for instead of their original purchase price. This change is put in place over time starting in 2022. The change does not start before 2025 for properties used by California businesses that meet certain rules and have 50 or fewer employees. Housing and agricultural land continues to be taxed based on its original purchase price. Some Lower Value Properties Not Included. This change does not apply if the owner has $3 million or less worth of commercial land and buildings in California djusted for inflation every two years). These properties continue to be taxed based on original purchase price. Reduce Taxes on Business Equipment. The measure reduces the taxable value of each business's equipment by $500,000 starting in 2024. Businesses with less than $500,000 of equipment pay no taxes on those items. All property taxes on business equipment are eliminated for California businesses that meet certain rules and have 50 or fewer employees. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nIncreased Taxes on Commercial Land and Buildings. Most owners of commercial land and buildings worth more than $3 million would pay higher property taxes. Only some of these property owners would start to pay higher taxes in 2022. By 2025, most of these property owners would pay higher taxes. Beginning in 2025, total property taxes from commercial land and buildings probably would be $8 billion to $12.5 billion higher in most years. The value of commercial property can change a lot from year to year. This means the amount of increased property taxes also could change a lot from year to year. Decreased Taxes on Business Equipment. Property taxes on business equipment probably would be several hundred million dollars lower each year. Money Set Aside to Pay Costs of the Measure. The measure sets aside money for various costs created by the measure. This includes giving several hundred million dollars per year to counties to pay for their costs of carrying out the measure. The measure would increase the amount of work county assessors do and could require changes in how they do their work. Counties could have costs from the measure before new money is available to cover these costs. The state would loan money to counties to cover these initial costs until new property tax revenue is available. New Funding for Local Governments and Schools. Overall, $6.5 billion to $11.5 billion per year in new property taxes would go to local governments. 60 percent would go to cities, counties, and special districts. Each city, county, or special district's share of the money depends on several things including the amount of new taxes paid by commercial properties in that community. Not all governments would be guaranteed new money. Some in rural areas may end up losing money because of lower taxes on business equipment. The other 40 percent would increase funding for schools and community colleges. Each school or community college's share of the money is mostly based on how many students they have.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: ALLOWS LEGISLATURE TO CHANGE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME PERIOD\n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\n\u2022 Establishes the time zone designated by federal law as \"Pacific standard time\u201d as the standard time within California. \u2022 Provides that California daylight saving time begins at 2 a.m. on the second Sunday of March and ends at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday of November, consistent with current federal law. \u2022 Permits the Legislature by two-thirds vote to make future changes to California's daylight saving time period, including for its year-round application, if changes are consistent with federal law. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 This measure has no direct fiscal effect because changes to daylight saving time would depend on future actions by the Legislature and potentially the federal government.\n\nBACKGROUND Federal Law Establishes Daylight Saving Time for Part of the Year. Federal law establishes a standard time zone for each area of the U.S. For example, California and other western states are in the Pacific standard time zone. Federal law requires the standard time of each zone to advance by one hour from early March to early November a period known as Daylight Saving Time (DST). During DST, sunrises and sunsets occur one hour later than they otherwise would. Currently, federal law does not allow states to adopt year-round DST. However, federal law allows states to opt out of DST and remain on standard time all year, as is currently the case in Arizona and Hawaii. \n\nCalifornia Voted on DST About 70 Years Ago. In 1949, California voters approved an initiative measure which established DST in California. The Legislature can only make changes to that initiative measure by submitting those changes to the voters for their approval.\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nProposition 7 allows the Legislature with a two-thirds vote to change DST (such as by remaining on DST year-round), as long as the change is allowed under federal law. Until any such change, California would maintain the current DST period. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS \n\nNo Direct Fiscal Effects on State and Local Governments. The measure would have no direct effect on state and local government costs or revenues. This is because any impacts would depend on future actions by the Legislature and potentially the federal government to change DST. \n\nPotential Impacts of Changes to DST. If the Legislature changed DST, there could be a variety of effects. For example, if the Legislature approved year-round DST, sunrises and sunsets would occur one hour later between November and March. Such a change could affect the net amount of energy used for lighting, heating, and cooling during those months. In addition, the current system of DST during part of the year likely affects the amount of sleep some people get when switching between standard time and DST twice a year. This potentially affects such things as worker productivity and the number of accidents. Year-round DST would eliminate these effects. The net effect of such changes on state and local government finances is unclear, but would likely be minor.\n\nPROPOSITION 7\n\nThis law proposed by Assembly Bill 807 of the 2017-2018 Regular Session (Chapter 60, Statutes of 2018) is submitted to the people in accordance with Section 10 of Article II of the California Constitution. This proposed law adds a section to the Government Code and repeals sections of the Daylight Saving Time Act; therefore, provisions proposed to be deleted are printed in strikeout type and new provisions to be added are printed in italic type to indicate that they are new. \n\nPROPOSED LAW \n\nSECTION 1. If federal law authorizes the state to provide for the year-round application of daylight saving time and the Legislature considers the adoption of this application, it is the intent of this act to encourage the Legislature to consider the potential impacts of year-round daylight saving time on communities along the border between California and other states and between California and Mexico. SEC. 2. Section 6808 is added to the Government Code, to read: 6808. (a) The standard time within the state is that of the fifth zone designated by federal law as Pacific standard time (15 U.S.C. Secs. 261 and 263). (b) The standard time within the state shall advance by one hour during the daylight saving time period commencing at 2 a.m. on the second Sunday of March of each year and ending at 2 a.m. on the first Sunday of November of each year. (c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), the Legislature may amend this section by a two-thirds vote to change the dates and times of the daylight saving time period, consistent with federal law, and, if federal law authorizes the state to provide for the year-round application of daylight saving time, the Legislature may amend this section by a two-thirds vote to provide for that application. SEC. 3. Section 1 of the Daylight Saving Time Act is repealed. Section 1. This act shall be known and may be cited as the Daylight Saving Time Act. SEC. 4. Section 2 of the Daylight Saving Time Act is repealed. Section 2. The standard time within the State, except as hereinafter provided, is that of the One Hundred and Twentieth (120th) degree of longitude west from Greenwich and which is now known, described and designated by Act of Congress as \"United States Standard Pacifie Time.\" SEC. 5. Section 3 of the Daylight Saving Time Act is repealed. Sec. 3. From 1 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of April, until 2 o'clock antemeridian on the last Sunday of October, the standard time in this State so established shall be one hour in advance of the standard time now known as United States Standard Pacifie time. SEC. 6. Section 4 of the Daylight Saving Time Act is repealed. Section 4. In all laws, statutes, orders, decrees, rules and regulations relating to the time of performance of any act by any officer or department of this State, or of any county, city and county, city, town or district thereof or relating to the time in which any rights shall accrue or determine, or within which any act shall or shall not be performed by any person subject to the jurisdiction of the State, and in all the public schools and in all other institutions of this State, or of any county, city and county, city, town or district thereof, and in all contracts or choses in actions made or to be performed in this State, the time shall be as set forth in this act and it shall be so understood and intended. SEC. 7. Section 5 of the Daylight Saving Time Act is repealed. SECTION 5. All acts in conflict herewith are hereby repealed.", "proposal_id": "d6db5563-a56c-407a-83a1-7a4fae1bd246.txt"}

Initiative STATUTE. ELECTION DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. VOTER FRAUD Penalties. Initiative StatUTE. * 32 * Prepared by the Attorney General \u2022 Allows persons who are legally eligible to vote and have valid identification to register to vote on election day at their polling place. \u2022 Increases criminal penalty for voter and voter registration fraud. \u2022 Criminalizes conspiracy to commit voter fraud. \u2022 Requires trained staff at polling places to manage election day registration, creates fund to implement measure, including training and providing personnel for election day registration. \u2022 Allows persons to register or reregister during 28 days preceding election day at local election offices. \u2022 Provides more time to county election officials to prepare voter registration lists. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 Annual state costs of about $6 million to fund counties for election day voter registration activities, thereby resulting in no anticipated net county cost. Title and Summary \u2022 Minor state administrative costs and unknown, but probably minor, state costs to enforce a new election fraud offense. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nUnder current law, Californians who want to vote in an upcoming election must register with county elections officials by the 15th day before the election. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nElection Day Registration. This measure allows eligible citizens, upon presenting proof of current residence, to register up to and including election day. Under the measure, citizens registering on or after the 28th day before an election must do so at the county elections office, or at a polling place on election day. Local elections officials must provide a separate area and at least one trained staff member at each polling place for election day voter registration. Additionally, the Secretary of State must include information about election day voter registration as part of all voter education efforts. Election Day Registration Fund. This measure establishes the \"Election Day Registration Fund\" within the State Treasury. Each year, approximately $6 million would be deposited into this fund from the state's General Fund and distributed to counties for their costs ELECTION DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. VOTER FRAUD PENALTIES. INITIATIVE STATUTE. For text of Proposition 52 see page 98. PROP 52 of election day voter registration including hiring and training additional personnel, providing voter registration materials, and expanding voter outreach programs. Counties receiving money from the fund would be required to submit an annual report identifying their expenditures. Increased Penalties for Voter Fraud. This measure increases the penalties for fraudulent registration or voting activity. It also creates a new crime of conspiracy of two or more people who commit specified election fraud, punishable by imprisonment in state prison. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nThis measure annually appropriates $6 million (adjusted for cost-of-living increases) from the state's General Fund for the county costs of election day voter registration activities. As a result, no net costs to counties are anticipated. Analysis The Secretary of State would incur minor costs to carry out the requirements of this measure. The state also would incur, unknown, but probably minor, criminal justice costs for individuals who commit a newly established election fraud offense. \n\nARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 52\n\nPROP 52 PROTECTS YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE AND PROTECTS AGAINST VOTER FRAUD. Every California citizen who is legally eligible should be able to vote on election day. Anyone who tries to vote illegally should be stopped and prosecuted. Presently, California law makes it nearly impossible for some citizens to vote-and too easy for others to commit voter fraud. Prop 52 ensures that every eligible citizen has the opportunity to vote, and increases penalties for voter fraud. Prop 52 will: ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 52 \u2022 Give all legally eligible citizens the right to vote on election day. \u2022 Allow legally eligible citizens to register and vote on election day only with a valid California driver's license or two required forms of identification proving they are California residents voting at the right polling place. \u2022 Double the penalties for voting illegally or for voter fraud. \u2022 Provide training to election day poll workers on processing voter registrations and preventing voter fraud. PROP 52 PREVENTS VOTER FRAUD. Under current state law, there's no requirement to show identification when registering to vote. Voter fraud laws are too weak and need to be strengthened. Currently county elections officials aren't required to report voter fraud to law enforcement officials. The existing system has loopholes that have even allowed pets to be registered as voters! Vote Yes on 52. Prop 52 protects against voter fraud by: \u2022 Making conspiracy to commit voter fraud a felony, punishable by a long jail sentence. \u2022 Requiring county elections officials to report fraudulent voting activities to the District Attorney. \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 52\n\nDon't be fooled. Prop. 52 is full of loopholes that corrupt our election process and will lead to widespread voter fraud. That's why Law Enforcement leaders like Contra Costa County District Attorney Gary Yancey, Ventura County District Attorney Mike Bradbury, Shasta County District Attorney McGregor Scott and Santa Barbara County Sheriff Jim Thomas all say NO on 52. FACT: Prop. 52 makes it easier for CRIMINALS and NON-CITIZENS to vote. That's not fair to qualified voters who follow the rules. FACT: Prop. 52 does not require a drivers license or other government identification to register and vote on Election Day. Under Prop. 52, a piece of junk mail is considered one of the valid forms of ID! 34 * FACT: Hidden in the fine print is a change in the law that makes proving FRAUD almost impossible. The authors of Proposition 52 are trying to fool you with talk of tough penalties. Tough penalties mean nothing if it's impossible to prove the crime was committed. Arguments Requiring unregistered voters who want to vote on election day to prove they are eligible by showing a valid California driver's license or two required forms of identification proving they are California residents voting at the right polling place. Requiring all polling places to clearly display both the rights of voters and the new penalties for voter fraud. \"Prop 52 will give law enforcement the vital new tools we need to deter and prevent voter fraud.\"-Grover Trask, Riverside County District Attorney PROP 52 PROTECTS YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE. Today in the U.S., only 49% of eligible voters vote. For the world's greatest democracy, that's pitiful. We should do everything possible to get more eligible citizens to the polls. The League of Women Voters of California, the California Professional Firefighters, and the California Nurses Association have all endorsed Prop 52 because they understand the importance of increasing voter turnout. Currently, outdated quirks in state law prevent many eligible citizens from voting on election day. For example, those who turn 18 or move a few weeks before an election could be deprived of the right to vote. States with laws like Prop 52 lead the nation in voter turnout. The anti-fraud provisions in Prop 52 provide vitally needed new protections against voter fraud. \"Our study shows that election day registration holds enormous promise. It is an easier way to vote. In California, Prop 52 should produce substantially higher voter turnout.\"-Mike Alvarez, Ph.D., Caltech LEE BACA Los Angeles County Sheriff MARCH FONG EU Former Secretary of State FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 52 FACT: 44 other states wisely DO NOT ALLOW Election Day registration. \"Prop. 52 would bilk taxpayers $6 million yearly for a program that allows dishonest politicians to steal elections.\"- Richard Gann, President, Gann Taxpayer Organization Remember Florida? Don't let it happen here. Other states are moving to tighten their laws against election fraud. Prop. 52 sends California in the opposite direction. The backers of Prop. 52 are trying to fool you. Don't let them get away with it. VOTE NO on 52\u2014PROTECT YOUR VOTE. VOTE NO on 52-STOP ELECTION FRAUD. HONORABLE ED JAGELS District Attorney of Kern County ROY BURNS, President Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs JILL SCHALL, President Women Prosecutors of California \n\nARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 52 \n\nProposition 52 makes it easier for CRIMINALS, DISHONEST POLITICIANS and NON-CITIZENS to commit ELECTION FRAUD. That's why District Attorneys, Sheriffs, Cops, and Elections Officials across California urge you to VOTE NO on 52. Prop. 52 appears well intentioned, until you read the fine print. This poorly drafted measure is full of LOOPHOLES and HIDDEN AGENDAS that will lead to MASSIVE ELECTION FRAUD in California. It's a classic example of a cure that is worse than the disease. PROP. 52 DOES NOT REQUIRE PHOTO IDENTIFICATION. California already has one of the most liberal elections laws in the nation. Registration forms are widely available and county elections officials have only 15 days to check for fraud and prepare voter rolls. But under Prop. 52, a person could register and cast a ballot on Election Day with \"identification\" that is nothing more than any piece of mail addressed to a udent lease agreement, credit card bill, or other unofficial identification. No photo ID would be required. em If Proposition 52 passes, elections officials will have no way of knowing if the person suddenly registering on Election Day is entitled to vote, or, for that matter, even a citizen of the United States. And they will have no time to check the validity of the registration before the ballot is cast. PROP. 52 MAKES IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT FRAUD AND OVERTURN ELECTIONS WON WITH PHONY VOTES. Under Prop. 52, ballots cast by those registering on Election Day will be mixed together with all other ballots. There will be no way for law enforcement and elections officials to go back after Election Day and determine if an ection was won by frau penalties against election fraud contained in Prop. 52 are useless, because the measure makes it impossible to ever prove the crime! District Attorneys, Sheriffs, Cops and Elections Officials OPPOSE Prop. 52. So do Republicans, Democrats, Labor and Taxpayer Groups. Working Californians OPPOSE Prop. 52. Our right to have our vote counted in fair elections will no longer exist in California if this measure passes. Forty-four other states wisely do not allow Election Day registration. PROP The six small states with laws similar to Prop. 52 are not like California. Our state is too big, and the potential for abuse too high, to enact a law that makes it easier to commit fraud. In a typical election, almost half of legally registered voters choose not to vote. Making it easier for FELONS, NON- CITIZENS AND OTHERS NOT QUALIFIED TO VOTE TO COMMIT FRAUD, will not solve the problem of low turn out.   In the wake of the controversy and chaos surrounding the 2000 Election in Florida, other states are looking to improve election laws and crack down on vote fraud. California must not go in the other direction by opening the door to fraud and election abuse. \u2022 PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY of our election system \u2022 PROTECT YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE in fair elections \u2022 STOP ELECTION FRAUD \u2022 Vote NO on PROP. 52! HONORABLE JAN SCULLY District Attorney of Sacramento County HONORABLE MIKE CARONA Sheriff of Orange County SHARON RUNNER, Co-Chair Citizens & Law Enforcement Against Election Fraud  \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 52 \n\nAfter the 2000 Presidential election people understood \"One vote can make a difference.\" Politics aside, one thing is clear-we need to protect our right to vote and ensure everyone who is eligible to vote-CAN VOTE! That's what Election Day Voter Registration does. States with election day registration lead the nation in turnout. A Cal-Tech/MIT election study found, \"California will experience an even larger increase in turnout...as much as one million new voters.\" A bipartisan group of elections experts wrote this law with protections making the process fair and convenient; with stiff penalties for politicians who try to steal elections. Prop 52 requires training for poll workers, requires allegations of fraud be reported to prosecutors and doubles the fines for fraud. ELECTION DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. VOTER FRAUD PENALTIES. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Misleading claims that Prop 52 will cause rampant fraud and allow unscrupulous individuals to cast several ballots just don't ring true. Opponents neglect to remind you that currently, you don't have to show ID when registering to vote or voting. Prop 52 adds new, strict identification requirements for election day registration: a photo I\u010e, or two forms of legally valid ID showing that the voter is voting in the correct precinct. BARBARA INATSUGU, President League of Women Voters of California ROCKY DELGADILLO Los Angeles City Attorney Politicians and bureaucrats claim that any reform will crash the system-the same arguments made about Motor Voter, Absentee Voting, and Campaign Finance Reform. But they all work. We can complain about California's low voter turnout or we can pass Prop 52-reform that will make a difference.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: AMENDS CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS. INITIATIVE STATUTE \n\nARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 24 \n\nThe world's biggest corporations are collecting deeply personal and private information about all of us. Sadly, our current laws aren't strong enough to protect us or our families from those who would abuse our most personal information. In 2018, the Legislature enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act. But since then, industry has repeatedly tried to weaken and limit enforcement of this law. Consumers need stronger protections. That's why we've introduced the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, to strengthen current privacy laws. In addition to monitoring our kids, many corporations track us constantly, from gym to office to clinic; they know our friends, jobs, weight, where we eat and how fast we're driving, our private searches and what we look at online. They also track and sell sensitive information like our race, sexual orientation, and religion. We believe we should be in control of our own information, and have the right to stop the use of our most sensitive personal information. OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OUR CHILDREN'S IS BEING ABUSED: Giant corporations make billions buying and selling our personal information-apps, phones, and cars sell your location constantly. The California Privacy Rights Act gives you the power to stop businesses tracking you precisely, like selling how many times you go to the gym or fast food restaurants to health insurers-without your knowledge or permission. Worse, these corporations don't keep your information safe. In 2018, there were a whopping 1,244,000,000 data breaches in the U.S., with over 446,000,000 records exposed, leading to massive identity theft. This measure holds big businesses accountable by imposing huge fines if they're negligent and don't keep your or your kids' health information, or Social Security numbers safe. THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT WOULD:\n\n1. PROTECT YOUR MOST PERSONAL INFORMATION, by allowing you to prevent businesses from using or sharing sensitive information about your health, finances, race, ethnicity, and precise location; 2. Safeguard young people, TRIPLING FINES for violations involving children's information; 3. Put new limits on companies' collection and use of our personal information; 4. Establish an enforcement arm-the California Privacy Protection Agency-to defend these rights and hold companies accountable, and extend enforcement including IMPOSING PENALTIES FOR NEGLIGENCE resulting in theft of consumers' emails and passwords. 5. MAKE IT MUCH HARDER TO WEAKEN PRIVACY in California in the future, by preventing special interests and politicians from undermining Californians' privacy rights, while allowing the Legislature to amend the law to further the primary goal of strengthening con≈sumer privacy to better protect you and your children, such as opt-in for use of data, further protections for uniquely vulnerable minors, and greater power for individuals to hold violators accountable. VOTE YES ON PROP. 24 TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT: California led the nation in enacting privacy rights, but big corporations are spending millions lobbying to weaken our laws. Instead, we need to make California privacy laws stronger. We need to safeguard our privacy protections, and hold corporations accountable when they violate our fundamental rights. For more information, visit: www.caprivacy.org. Please join us and VOTE YES ON PROP. 24. JAMES P. STEYER, CEO Common Sense Media ALICE A. HUFFMAN, President California NAACP CELINE MACTAGGART, Director Californians for Consumer Privacy\n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 24\n\nWe work every day to protect the rights of all Californians. We OPPOSE Proposition 24 because it stacks the deck in favor of big tech corporations and reduces your privacy rights. If Proposition 24 REALLY strengthened privacy protections, we'd fight for it. But the truth is, its 52 pages are full of giveaways to social media and tech giants. Proposition 24's funder hopes you won't read its fine print. If you do, you'll see it reduces your rights under current law, giving big tech businesses new ways to collect your private 24 information, like data from health and financial apps, and tracking where you go.  Proposition 24 asks you to approve \"pay for privacy,\" letting companies charge more to safeguard your personal information. It's hard enough for financially strapped Californians to access high-speed internet for essential services, healthcare, and school during a pandemic. Pay for privacy has racially discriminatory impacts, disproportionately pricing out working people, seniors, and Black and Latino families. All Californians deserve privacy, not just the wealthy. Proposition 24 restricts Californians from enforcing your own privacy rights in court. It wants you to trust a brand new state agency, created during a budget crunch, to protect your rights. Proposition 24 was written behind closed doors with input from the same tech companies with histories of profiting off of your personal information in unfair and discriminatory ways. It puts more power in the hands of tech companies like Facebook that already have too much power. It protects big tech business, not people. Vote No on Proposition 24. KEVIN BAKER, Director Center for Advocacy and Policy, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of California NAN BRASMER, President California Alliance for Retired Americans JOHN MATHIAS, Deputy Senior Campaign Director Color of Change\n\nARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 24 \n\nVote No on Proposition 24 because it was written behind closed doors with input from giant tech corporations that collect and misuse our personal information-while the measure's sponsor rejected almost every suggestion from 11 privacy and consumer rights groups. Proposition 24 reduces privacy protections by severely weakening your rights under current California law. Make no mistake\u2014the privacy of every Californian at stake! The real winners with Proposition 24 are the biggest social media platforms, giant tech companies and credit reporting corporations who get more freedom to invade the privacy of workers and consumers, and to continue sharing your credit data. Here's what they won't tell you about the 52 pages of fine print: Proposition 24 asks you to approve an Internet \"pay for privacy\" scheme. Those who don't pay more could get inferior service-bad connections, slower downloads and more pop up ads. It's an electronic version of freeway express lanes for the wealthy and traffic jams for everyone else. Currently, employers can obtain all kinds of personal information about their workers and even job applicants, including things like using a pregnancy tracking app, where you go to worship or if you attend a political protest. Proposition 24 allows employers to continue secretly gathering this information for more years to come, overriding a new law that lets workers know what sensitive private information their bosses have beginning January 1, 2021. Under California law, your privacy rights follow you wherever you go. But with Proposition 24, the minute you travel out of state with a phone, wearable device, or computer, big tech companies are allowed to capture the health, financial, and other confidential information you stored on your device. You can set web browsers and cell phones to send a signal to each website you visit and app you use to stop selling your personal data, so you don't have to think about it each time. Proposition 24 would allow companies to disregard those instructions shift the burden to you to notify each and every website and app individually to protect your data. Proposition 24's new enforcement agency sounds good, but when tech corporations get caught violating your privacy, all they have to do is cooperate with the agency and their only penalty could be a slap on the wrist. California's new privacy law just took effect this year. Smaller businesses spent a lot of money to comply with the new regulations. Before we even know how this new law is working, Proposition 24 rewrites it, forcing smaller businesses to absorb even more costs at a time that the economic slowdown has many businesses on the verge of closing their doors. Proposition 24 was written to accommodate big social media platforms and the Internet and technology companies that spend tens of millions of dollars a year to lobby government at all levels to avoid laws that hurt their profits. Proposition 24 is a bonanza for them and a big step back for consumer privacy.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: Veterans' Homes Bond Act of 2000. \n\nOfficial Title and Summary Prepared by the Attorney General \n\nVETERANS' HOMES BOND ACT OF 2000. \u2022 This fifty million dollar ($50,000,000) bond issue will provide funding to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the purpose of designing and constructing veterans' homes in California and completing a comprehensive renovation of the Veterans' Home at Yountville. \u2022 Funds from this bond shall be allocated to fund the state's matching requirement to construct or renovate those veterans' homes in Military and Veterans Code section 1011 first, and then fund any additional homes established under this Act. Appropriates money from General Fund to pay off bonds. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 Net state cost of about $33 million over 25 years to pay off $26 million in additional bonds. The average cost would be around $1 million per year.\n\nBackground\n\nThe state Department of Veterans Affairs operates two residential homes for veterans-one at Yountville, Napa County and the other at Barstow, San Bernardino County. The Yountville home has the capacity to house 1,421 veterans, and Barstow can house 400. These facilities provide residential services, nursing, and medical care primarily for elderly or disabled California veterans. The cost to construct new or renovate existing veterans' homes is generally shared between the state (35 percent) and the federal government (65 percent). Existing law authorizes the use of $36 million of lease-payment bonds for the state's share of the cost to construct three new homes in Southern California. One of these homes is under construction at Chula Vista, San Diego County. This home, which is planned to open by April 2000, will be able to house 400 veterans. The two other homes are to be constructed at Lancaster, Los Angeles County, and Saticoy, Ventura County. \n\nProposal\n\nThis proposition authorizes the state to sell $50 million of general obligation bonds to pay the state's share of the cost for construction and renovation of new and existing veterans' homes. General obligation bonds are backed by the state, meaning that the state is required to pay the principal and interest costs on these bonds. General Fund revenues would be used to pay these costs. These revenues come primarily from state personal and corporate income taxes and the sales tax. Uses of the Bonds. The $50 million in bonds would be used for two purposes: \u2022 First, $24 million would replace lease-payment bonds currently available for veterans' homes. Lease-payment bonds are similar to general obligation bonds in that General Fund revenues are used to pay off the bonds. Lease-payment bonds, however, are more costly because they have higher interest rates and selling costs. \u2022 Second, the remaining $26 million in general obligation bonds would be available for (1) additional new veterans' homes (that is, beyond the three new homes in Southern California) and/or (2) renovation of existing homes.\n\nFiscal Effects\n\nBond Costs. This proposition would affect the state's cost in two ways. Most significantly, it allows $26 million in additional bonds. The cost of repaying these bonds would be offset by some savings from the replacement of higher-cost lease-payment bonds with general obligation bonds. We estimate that the net impact would be costs of about $33 million over a 25-year period. The average cost would be around $1 million per year. Operating Costs. To the extent that the bond funds are used to add beds at new or existing veterans' homes, state operating costs for these homes would increase to care for additional veterans. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 16\n\nNot all state problems are measured in the billions. Proposition 16 asks for your support for $50 million in bonds to pay the state's share of retirement homes for United States military veterans who are California residents. These veterans fought for our country in World War II, Korea, Vietnam and other hotspots around the globe. They put their lives on the line in defense of this country. It is our obligation to make sure they have a place to live if they can no longer care for themselves. Proposition 16 will not raise your taxes. The bonds will be paid from taxes already being collected. No new taxes will be raised or collected to fund this bond act. Proposition 16 will pay the state's share to build two new veterans' retirement homes that have been approved for construction by the state of California. Proposition 16 will rehabilitate the 100-year old Veterans Home at Yountville. \n\nProposition 16 will build a special treatment center to treat veterans with dementia problems like Alzheimer's disease. Proposition 16 is supported by the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and other state veterans' organizations, as well as AARP and service and civic groups. It passed overwhelmingly in the state Assembly and Senate. We believe that Proposition 16 meets the needs of the U.S. military men and women who served this nation with distinction. Please vote \"yes\" for our veterans. Vote \"yes\" on Proposition 16. We appreciate your consideration. GRAY DAVIS Governor, State of California JOHN MCCAIN U.S. Senator, Arizona JOE DUNN State Senator, 34th District\n\nRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition\n\nBond supporters always say that the measure will not increase taxes. How then will the bonds be paid? Taxpayers must pay the principal and interest on the bonds for 30 years. This money comes from our tax dollars. Taxpayers are currently paying over $3 billion per year on existing bond debt. As the governor tells it, Proposition 16 is small potatoes. $50 million gets lost in a state with a budget of $81 billion. Indeed, there are dozens of appropriations just like this one. That's why we're baffled why the legislators and the governor didn't just pay the $50 million out of the state budget. Since bond financing almost doubles the cost of any government project, it seems like they are purposely trying to cost taxpayers more than necessary.\n\nWe agree that our veterans are deserving of respect. If indeed we seek a place for elderly or infirm veterans to live, it would be a lot less expensive to place them in private retirement homes and hospitals. The government could contract with existing facilities\u2014not build new ones. Of course, all of the veterans organizations support this. Of course, almost every legislator voted for it. After all, it's easy to cast a \"pro-veteran\" vote. But when will our legislators be really courageous and cast a pro-taxpayer vote? GAIL K. LIGHTFOOT Past Chair, Libertarian Party of California LARRY HINES U.S. Marine Corps veteran TED BROWN Insurance Adjuster/Investigator\n\nArgument Against Proposition 16\n\nIn an orgy of spending, California legislators passed an $81 billion budget for Fiscal Year 2000. That's up from $63 billion just four years ago. There was a $4 billion budget surplus this year. That's money that should have been refunded to taxpayers. In fact, each family could have received over $330 to spend as they chose. But instead most of our legislators-Democrat and Republican alike-found ways to spend this money on new government programs. What does this have to do with Proposition 16? Well, if the legislators had an extra $4 billion to play around with, why didn't they spend a relatively paltry $50 million of it (about 1.25% of the surplus) on the proposed veterans homes and save us more election costs? No, they couldn't do that. They had to spend it immediately. Now if voters say \"yes\" on Proposition 16, the veterans homes won't just cost $50 million. BONDS ALMOST DOUBLE THE COST OF ANY GOVERNMENT PROJECT. Taxpayers will have to pay the interest on these bonds for the next 25 years. So, at the end, we'll be out about $90 million. So we see that this proposalwould have cost a lot less if it was paid for out of the current budget. But let's ask: do we really need to build these veterans homes at all? The federal government, under the Department of Veterans Affairs, provides generous benefits to our veterans from medical care, to job training, to college education, to no money down home loans. There's really no need for the State of California to provide any veterans benefits. \n\nThere are 1525 veterans currently staying at veterans homes in Yountville and Barstow. This is not a big number. Proposition 16 seeks funds to build even more of these small facilities. It's highly likely that these veterans receive a pension from the federal government, and perhaps from a career subsequent to their military service. Should California taxpayers be providing them with shelter? It seems as if they and their families could arrange this privately. Even if we concede that California taxpayers should pay to house veterans, the veterans could stay at privately-owned retirement facilities. Whenever the government is involved in a building project, it costs a lot more than a private enterprise project. Governments require an expensive approval process, then require contractors to pay the prevailing union wage for construction, which is more than the low bidder would pay. The losers: the taxpayers. Send a message to legislators. There are alternatives to spending tax money on veterans homes. There also should be some punishment for squandering a hefty budget surplus, instead of refunding it to taxpayers, or even spending it on this relatively small project. Please vote No on Proposition 16. GAIL K. LIGHTFOOT Past Chair, Libertarian Party of California TED BROWN Insurance Adjuster/Investigator LARRY HINES U.S. Marine Corps Veteran \n\nRebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 16 \n\nPearl Harbor, Iwo Jima, Omaha Beach, Utah Beach, Battle of the Bulge, Inch'on, Khe Sanh, Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo. These are some of the battle sites where U.S. military veterans took up arms in defense of Democracy. Our friends, buddies and relatives fought the enemies of this great country on foreign soil. Hundreds of thousands did not return. Millions were wounded in battle, many seriously. Those of us who came home alive returned with a heavy heart for comrades in arms who did not return with us. But we also returned with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment. Proposition 16 is about those who lived, those of us who risked our lives and returned to help build this great state and country. This bond measure is about us-and the more than three million U.S. veterans in this state who we represent.\n\nWe do not ask much. But we do ask you, the voter, to think about the freedoms you enjoy because of veterans who did their duty and put their lives in jeopardy so that we could all live free. We answered the call when our country needed our help. We now ask you to consider supporting this modest measure to build veterans' homes for aging veterans who can no longer care for themselves. Proposition 16 will not raise your taxes. No new taxes will be raised or collected to fund this measure. We appreciate your support and consideration. Please vote \"yes\" on Proposition 16.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: LIMIT ON MARRIAGES\n\nOfficial Title and Summary Prepared by the Attorney General \n\nLIMIT ON MARRIAGES. INITIATIVE STATUTE. \u2022 Adds a provision to the Family Code providing that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California. \n\nSummary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 Probably no fiscal effect on the state or local governments.  \n\nBackground\n\nUnder current California law, \u201cmarriage\u201d is based on a civil contract between a man and a woman. Current law also provides that a legal marriage that took place outside of California is generally considered valid in California. No state in the nation currently recognizes a civil contract or any other relationship between two people of the same sex as a marriage.  \n\nProposal\n\nThis measure provides that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nThis measure would likely have no fiscal effect on the state or local governments. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 22 \n\nDear Fellow Voter: I'm a 20-year-old woman voting for only the second time on March 7th. I'm proud, excited, and a bit nervous, because I take my civic responsibilities seriously. Not only that, but among millions of people supporting Proposition 22, the Protection of Marriage Initiative, I have the honor of writing you to explain why Californians should vote \"Yes\" on 22. Proposition 22 is exactly 14 words long: \"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California.\" That's it! No legal doubletalk, no hidden agenda. Just common sense: Marriage should be between a man and a woman. It does not take away anyone's right to inheritance or hospital visitation. When people ask, \u201cWhy is this necessary?\u201d I say that even though California law already says only a man and a woman may marry, it also recognizes marriages from other states. However, judges in some of those states want to define marriage differently than we do. If they succeed, California may have to recognize new kinds of marriages, even though most people believe marriage should be between a man and a woman. California is not alone in trying to keep marriage between a man and a woman. In 1996, Democrats and Republicans in Congress overwhelmingly passed a bill saying that the U.S. government defines marriage as between a man and a woman only, and said each state could do the same. President Clinton signed the bill the day after he received it. So far, 30 states have passed laws defining marriage as between a man and a woman. \n\nNow it's our turn, and I'm voting \"Yes\" on 22 to ensure that decisions affecting California are voted on by Californians like us. It's Our State, it should be Our Choice. But some people today think marriage doesn't matter anymore. They say I have to accept that marriage can mean whatever anyone says it means, and if I don't agree then I'm out of touch, even an extremist. My family taught me to respect other people's freedoms. Everyone should. But that's a two way street. If people want me to respect their opinions and lifestyles, then they should grant me the same courtesy by respecting MY beliefs. And I believe that marriage should stay the way it is. It's tough enough for families to stay together these days. Why make it harder by telling children that marriage is just a word anyone can re-define again and again until it no longer has any meaning? Marriage is an important part of our lives, our families and our future. Someday I hope to meet a wonderful man, marry and have children of my own. By voting \"Yes\" on 22, I'm doing my part today to keep that dream alive. Please, for all future generations, vote \"Yes\" on 22. Miriam G. Santacruz We couldn't have said it better! As representatives of seniors, teachers and parents, we're proud to join Californians from all walks of life voting \"Yes\" on 22. JEANNE MURRAY Field Director; 60 Plus Association GARY BECKNER Executive Director, Association of American Educators THOMAS FONG President, Chinese Family Alliance \n\nRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 22\n\nTHE HIDDEN AGENDA \n\nThe proponents of Proposition 22 want you to think that it is simple. That there is no \"hidden agenda\". But if it's so simple, why are they spending millions of dollars to put this measure on the ballot and convince you to vote for something they say is \"common sense\"? Why are they spending millions of dollars to convince you to vote for something that is already law in California? \n\nPROPOSITION 22 WILL HELP DENY HOSPITAL VISITATION RIGHTS \n\nThe proponents of Proposition 22 say that Proposition 22 doesn't deny hospital visitation or inheritance rights for lesbians and gays. But in Florida and Virginia, arch-conservative legal organizations have used similar laws as tools in court to deny lesbians and gays fundamental rights like the right to visit a sick or injured partner in the hospital, the right to inheritance, or the right to health insurance. \n\nA SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM \n\nYou don't need to support marriage for lesbian and gay couples to oppose Proposition 22. As the proponents of Prop 22 admit, \"California law already says only a man and a woman may marry.\" That won't change if Proposition 22 passes. government to interfere with our personal lives. Proposition 22 is just another needless law that allows \n\nMARRIAGE MATTERS \n\nOf course marriage matters. But so do fairness and tolerance. Proposition 22 will do nothing to strengthen our families, our communities, or to strengthen the commitment of couples involved in marriage. It will only divide California. GIL GARCETTI District Attorney, County of Los Angeles DELAINE EASTIN California State Superintendent of Public Instruction THE RIGHT REVEREND WILLIAM E. SWING Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California   \n\nArgument Against Proposition 22 \n\nThe California Interfaith Alliance The League of Women Voters of California The California Teachers Association Senator Dianne Feinstein Senator Barbara Boxer Congressman Tom Campbell Vice President Al Gore Senator Bill Bradley The California Republican League And thousands of husbands, wives, mothers and fathers from across California oppose Proposition 22. THE PURPOSE OF PROPOSITION 22 IS NOT TO BAN MARRIAGE FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES IN CALIFORNIA. IT IS ALREADY BANNED. You don't need to support marriage for gay and lesbian couples to oppose Proposition 22, the \"Knight Initiative\". You just have to believe in a few basic values-keeping government out of our personal lives, respecting each other's privacy, and not singling out one group for discrimination or for special rights. VOTING NO ON 22 WILL NOT LEGALIZE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, NO MATTER WHAT THE SUPPORTERS OF PROPOSITION 22 SAY. The real purpose is to use Proposition 22 as a tool in court to deny basic civil rights to lesbians and gays and their families. Proposition 22 will be used, as similar laws have been in other states, to deny the right of partners to visit their sick or injured companion in hospitals, to deny the right to inheritance, and even to deny the right of a remaining companion to live in their home. PROPOSITION 22 WILL RESULT IN UNNECESSARY GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE. Whether we think homosexuality is right or wrong, we should stay out of other people's private lives and let people make their own decisions about moral values and commitments. Californians treasure our right to be left alone and to lead our lives the way we wish. Adding more laws about private behavior and personal relationships isn't a solution to anything. PROPOSITION 22 DIVIDES US. Californians have seen too many efforts in recent years to pick on specific groups of people and single them out for discrimination. Supporters of Proposition 22 are spending millions of dollars to convince you that basic rights should be denied to a group of Californians. They want us to believe that attacking same-gender couples will solve problems instead of causing them. But we've seen what spreading fear and hatred has already done. According to the Attorney General, more than 2,000 Californians were victimized by hate crimes last year alone. California has had enough of the politics of fear and hate. Voting \"No\" on 22 will send that message. PROPOSITION 22 IS UNFAIR. Even when gay or lesbian couples have been together for many years, one companion often has no right to visit a sick or injured companion in the hospital. They often can't get basic health insurance for dependents. They have no inheritance rights. That's wrong. And Proposition 22 will make it more difficult to right this wrong-by singling out lesbians and gays for discrimination. Proposition 22 doesn't solve any problems. It adds more government interference to our lives . . . It singles out one group for attack . . . It tears us apart instead of bringing us together. VOTE NO ON 22. ANTONIO R.

SWING Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of California KRYS WULFF President, American Association of University Women, California \n\nRebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 22\n\nWe are proud to join Focus on the Family and nearly 700,000 California voters who signed petitions in support of Proposition 22. Here's why: \"Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California. That's all Proposition 22 says, and that's all it does. It's just common sense. Opponents say anybody supporting traditional marriage is guilty of extremism, bigotry, hatred and discrimination towards gays, lesbians and their families.  That's unfair and divisive nonsense. THE TRUTH IS, we respect EVERYONE'S freedom to make lifestyle choices, but draw the line at re-defining marriage for the rest of society. Opponents say Proposition 22 is unnecessary. THE TRUTH IS, UNLESS WE PASS PROPOSITION 22, LEGAL LOOPHOLES COULD FORCE CALIFORNIA T\u00d3 RECOGNIZE \"SAME-SEX MARRIAGES\" PERFORMED IN OTHER STATES. That's why 30 other states and the federal government have passed laws to close these loopholes. California deserves the same choice. Opponents claim 22 will take away hospital visitation and inheritance rights, even throw people out of their homes. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY FALSE! Do they really expect voters to believe that? THE TRUTH IS, PROPOSITION 22 DOESN'T TAKE AWAY ANYONE'S RIGHTS. Whatever you think of \u201csame-sex marriages\u201d, we can all agree that our opponents' use of scare tactics and deceit is the wrong way to address important issues.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: Eliminates Certain Road Repair and Transportation Funding. Requires Certain Fuel Taxes and Vehicle Fees Be Approved by the Electorate. Initiative Constitutional Amendment. \n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\n\u2022 Repeals a 2017 transportation law's tax and fee provisions that pay for repairs and improvements to local roads, state highways, and public transportation. \u2022 Requires the Legislature to submit any measure enacting specified taxes or fees on gas or diesel fuel, or on the privilege to operate a vehicle on public highways, to the electorate for approval. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 Reduced ongoing state revenues of $5.1 billion from the elimination of fuel and vehicle taxes passed by the Legislature in 2017. These revenues mainly would have paid for highway and road maintenance and repairs, as well as transit programs. \u2022 The requirement that voters approve new or increased fuel and vehicle taxes passed by the Legislature in the future could result in lower revenues from such taxes than otherwise would have been available. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAPPROVAL OF STATE TAXES\nLegislative Requirements. Under the State Constitution, the Legislature can only pass a new tax or increase an existing tax with a two-thirds vote. (The Legislature can pass most other types of laws with a simple majority.) Some state charges referred to as fees (such as vehicle license fees) fall under the constitutional definition of a tax. Voter Approval Requirements. The Legislature does not need to get voter approval for new or increased taxes that it passes. The voters\u2014through the initiative process can pass new taxes or increase existing taxes without the Legislature's involvement.\nSTATE FUEL AND VEHICLE TAXES Fuel Taxes. The state charges excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel. These taxes are set on a per-gallon basis. The state also charges sales taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel. These taxes are set as a percent of the price of the fuel. The State Constitution generally requires that the revenues from these fuel taxes be spent on highways, roads, and transit. Vehicle Taxes. State law requires vehicle owners to pay two specific taxes for the privilege of operating a vehicle on public highways. These are (1) vehicle license fees and (2) recently enacted transportation improvement fees, both of which are based on a vehicle's value. The State Constitution requires that the transportation improvement fee revenues be spent on highways, roads, and transit. TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IN CALIFORNIA Transportation funding in California currently is estimated to total $35 billion. Of this amount, $16 billion comes from local sources, $12 billion from state sources, and $7 billion from federal sources. Local funding mainly comes from sales taxes, transit fares, and city and county general funds, while federal funding mainly comes from federal fuel taxes. State funding mainly comes from state fuel and vehicle taxes. State funding has increased by about three-quarters over the last two years mainly due to recent legislation. Recent State Transportation Funding Legislation. In 2017, the Legislature enacted Senate Bill (SB) 1 to increase annual state funding for transportation through various fuel and vehicle taxes (shown in Figure 1). Specifically, SB 1 increased the base gasoline excise tax (by 12 cents per gallon) and the diesel sales tax (by 4 percent). It also set fixed rates on a second (add-on) gasoline excise tax and the diesel excise tax, both of which previously could change each year based on fuel prices. Further, SB 1 created the transportation improvement fee (which ranges from $25 to $175 per year) and a fee specifically for zero-emission vehicles (set at $100 per year for model years 2020 and later). It also provides for inflation adjustments in the future. This fiscal year, the state expects the taxes to raise $4.4 billion. Two years from now, when all the taxes are in effect and the inflation adjustments have started, the state expects the taxes to raise $5.1 billion. The State Constitution requires that nearly all of these new revenues be spent on transportation purposes. Senate Bill 1 dedicates about two-thirds of the revenues to highway and road repairs, with the remainder going to other programs (such as for mass transit). \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nRequires Legislature to Get Voter Approval for Fuel and Vehicle Taxes. Proposition 6 amends the State Constitution to require the Legislature to get voter approval for new or increased taxes on the sale, storage, use, or consumption of gasoline or diesel fuel, as well as for taxes paid for the privilege of operating a vehicle on public highways. Thus, the Legislature would need voter approval for such taxes as gasoline and diesel excise and sales taxes, vehicle license fees, and transportation improvement fees. Figure 1 Senate Bill 1 Revenues Gasoline Taxes Excise (base) Excise (add-on) Diesel Taxes Excise Sales Vehicle Taxes Transportation improvement fee Zero-emission vehicle fee Totals Tax Rates Prior Rates ELIMINATES CERTAIN ROAD REPAIR AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. PROPOSITION REQUIRES CERTAIN FUEL TAXES AND VEHICLE FEES BE APPROVED 6 BY THE ELECTORATE. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. 18 cents Varieda Varied 1.75 percent New Rates 30 cents 17.3 cents 36 cents 5.75 percent $25 to $175 $100 Eliminates Recently Enacted Fuel and Vehicle Taxes. Proposition 6 also eliminates any such fuel and vehicle taxes passed by the Legislature after January 1, 2017 and up to the date that Proposition 6 takes effect in December. This would eliminate the increased fuel taxes and the transportation improvement fees enacted by SB 1. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nEliminates Tax Revenues From SB 1. In the current fiscal year, Proposition 6 would reduce SB 1 tax revenues from $4.4 billion to $2 billion-a $2.4 billion decrease. (The $2 billion in remaining revenues would be from taxes collected prior to Proposition 6 taking effect in December.) Two years from now, the revenue reduction would total $5.1 billion annually. The funding reductions would mainly affect highway and road maintenance and repair programs, as well as transit programs. Makes Passage of Specified Fuel and Vehicle Taxes More Difficult. Proposition 6 would make it more difficult to enact specified fuel and vehicle taxes because voters also would have to approve them. As a result, there could be less revenue than otherwise would be the case. Any reduction in revenues is unknown, as it would depend on future actions by the Legislature and voters. \n\n(3) Notwithstanding Section 75.10, Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 75) shall be utilized for purposes of implementing this subdivision, including adjustments of the new base year value of replacement dwellings acquired prior to the sale of the original property. (4) In the case where a form under this section has been timely filed, and new construction is performed upon the replacement dwelling subsequent to the transfer of base year value, the property tax relief provided by this section also shall apply to the replacement dwelling, as improved, and thus there shall be no reassessment upon completion of the new construction if the new construction is completed within two years of the date of the sale of the original property and the owner notifies the assessor in writing of completion of the new construction within six months after completion. (i) With respect to the transfer of the base year value of original properties to replacement dwellings, this section shall apply to any replacement dwelling that is purchased or newly constructed on or after January 1, 2019.

I've been a Lyft driver for five years. I like the flexibility. Before COVID-19, I drove 40 hours a week. I drive less now but understand why. What I don't understand is why Uber and Lyft refuse to treat me as an employee since that's California law. Right now, they don't pay minimum wage or overtime. They don't give us paid sick time. They shift the cost of doing business onto us. That's wrong. Vote No on 22. They also don't think I deserve healthcare or protections of an \"essential\" employee. When COVID-19 hit, they wouldn't even cover my unemployment benefits. But they paid $5,000,000 to put 22 on the ballot. And they say they'll spend another ONE HUNDRED MILLION to pass it.\n\nDrivers like me would've used that money for PPE or more sanitation stations to protect us and keep our customers safe. If we got sick, we'd even have healthcare. Uber and Lyft claim I want to be \"independent.\" What I really want is to be safe and paid a living wage. That would give me independence. Recent studies show 70% of Uber and Lyft drivers work 30 or more hours a week-just like me-and our wages would be WORSE under Prop. 22. How's that fair? Billion-dollar companies shouldn't get to pick and choose the laws they follow or write their own, like Prop. 22. Please join me and driver groups representing over 50,000 drivers: VOTE NO on Prop. 22. JEROME GAGE, Lyft Driver \n\nARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 22\n\nUber, Lyft, and DoorDash paid to put Proposition 22 on the November ballot. They hired lawyers to write this misleading initiative and paid political operatives millions to collect the voter signatures needed. Why? EXEMPTS APP-BASED TRANSPORTATION AND DELIVERY COMPANIES PROPOSITION FROM PROVIDING EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN DRIVERS. INITIATIVE STATUTE. 22 \u2605 ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 22 \u2605 To create a special exemption for themselves that will legally deny their driver's basic rights and protections at work like paid sick leave; workers' compensation, or unemployment benefits. Prop. 22 ONLY applies to Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and other app-based delivery and transportation companies. Their goal is PROFIT. Only THESE companies would profit from this special exemption. Current law requires Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash to provide their drivers with a minimum wage, healthcare, paid sick leave, unemployment, and workers' compensation coverage, just like every other California business. \u2022 The Attorney General recently sued them for breaking the law and for relentlessly avoiding responsibility to their drivers for years. With your vote, you can help make them stop! Vote NO on Prop. 22. Why vote No on Proposition 22? Prop. 22 creates a special exemption that eliminates basic workplace benefits and replaces them with a new LOWER \"earnings guarantee\" and \"healthcare subsidy\" payments designed to save the companies money. \u2022 Prop. 22 contains deceptive wording to cynically try to convince us they are strengthening driver protections. The truth is, Uber and Lyft are ALREADY required to perform background checks, and the new provisions would ELIMINATE required sexual harassment training and the obligations on Uber and Lyft to investigate customers' and drivers' sexual harassment claims. \u2022 The bottom line: Prop. 22 is all about money. It's not about helping the drivers you meet if you use these apps. \n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 further exposed these companies' refusal to treat their drivers fairly. The New York Times editorial board recently wrote that these companies \"have failed to enforce consistent safety measures during the pandemic, including providing sufficient numbers of masks or guidance on social distancing, while pushing workers to fulfill an ever greater number of orders to keep up with the rising demand for food deliveries.\" These drivers, 78% of whom are people of color, are ESSENTIAL. They've helped California through the pandemic, and they deserve better. We believe app drivers, many Latino, Black, or from other communities of color, SHOULD have sick leave, healthcare, unemployment benefits, AND flexibility in their scheduling. So don't let Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash confuse the issue. They claim this is about \"flexibility\" for \"part-time\" drivers. However, current law in no way limits driver flexibility. In fact, a University of California study found that a majority drivers are not part-time, and over 70 percent of drivers for Uber and Lyft work 30 or more hours per week. Don't take our word. Read for yourself at transform.ucsc.edu/on-demand-and-on-the-edge. Prop. 22 was written by Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash for Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, NOT their drivers. That's why tens of thousands of drivers have joined us to urge a NO vote. Don't let Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash write their own special law. Vote No on Proposition 22.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: CHANGES CERTAIN PROPERTY TAX RULES. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. \n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\n\u2022 Permits homeowners who are over 55, severely disabled, or whose homes were destroyed by wildfire or disaster, to transfer their primary residence's property tax base value to a replacement residence of any value, anywhere in the state. \u2022 The text of this measure can be found on the Secretary of State's website at voterguide.sos.ca.gov. \u2022 Limits tax benefits for certain transfers of real property between family members. Expands tax benefits for transfers of family farms. \u2022 Allocates most resulting state revenues and savings (if any) to fire protection services and reimbursing local governments for taxation-related changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 Local governments could gain tens of millions of dollars of property tax revenue per year. These gains could grow over time to a few hundred million dollars per year. \u2022 Schools could gain tens of millions of dollars of property tax revenue per year. These gains could grow over time to a few hundred million dollars per year. \u2022 Revenue from other taxes could increase by tens of millions of dollars per year for both the state and local governments. Most of this new state revenue would be spent on fire protection. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nLocal Governments Tax Property. California cities, counties, schools, and special districts (such as a fire protection district) collect property taxes from property owners based on the value of their property. Property taxes raise around $65 billion each year for these local governments. \n\nHow Is a Property Tax Bill Calculated? \n\nEach property owner's annual property tax bill is equal to the taxable value of their property multiplied by their property tax rate. The typical property owner's property tax rate is 1.1 percent. In the year a new owner takes over a property, its taxable value typically is its purchase price. Each year after that, the property's taxable value is adjusted for inflation by up to 2 percent. When a property changes ownership again, its taxable value is reset to its new purchase price. Property Taxes Increase When a Property Changes Ownership. The taxable value of most properties is less than what they could be sold for. This is because the price most properties could sell for grows faster than 2 percent per year. Because of this, when a property changes ownership its taxable value often resets to a higher amount. This leads to higher property tax bill for that property. This means people who move usually end up paying higher property taxes for their new home than they paid for their old home. Special Rules for Some Homeowners. In some cases, special rules allow existing homeowners to move to a different home without paying higher property taxes. These special rules apply to homeowners who are over 55 or severely disabled or whose property has been impacted by a natural disaster or contamination. We refer to these people as \"eligible homeowners.\" An eligible homeowner can Imove within the same county and keep paying the same amount of property taxes if their new home is not more expensive than their existing home. Also, certain counties allow these rules to apply when an eligible homeowner moves to their county from another county. Homeowners who are over 55 or severely disabled generally can use these special rules only once in their lifetime. This limit does apply to properties impacted by a natural disaster or contamination. \n\nSpecial Rules for Inherited Properties. Special rules also allow properties to pass between parents and children without an increase in the property tax bill. These rules also apply to grandparents and grandchildren if the grandchildren's parents are deceased. We call properties passed between parents and children or grandparents and grandchildren \"inherited property.\" The rules apply to a parent's or grandparent's home and a limited amount of other types of property. Counties Manage the Property Tax. County assessors determine the taxable value of property. County tax collectors bill property owners. County auditors distribute tax revenue to local governments. Statewide, counties spend about $800 million each year on these activities. Schools Funding Comes From Both Local Property Taxes and State Taxes. Schools receive funding from both local property taxes and state taxes. State law says that schools must receive a minimum amount of total funding from these two sources. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nThe measure makes changes to the special rules for eligible homeowners and inherited properties. Expanded Special Rules for Eligible Homeowners. Starting April 1, 2021, the measure expands the special rules for eligible homeowners. Specifically, the measure: \u2022 Allows Moves Anywhere in the State. Eligible homeowners could keep their lower property tax bill when moving to another home anywhere in the state. \u2022 Allows the Purchase of a More Expensive Home. Eligible homeowners could use the special rules to move to a more expensive home. Their property tax bill would still go up but not by as much as it would be for other homebuyers. \u2022 Increases Number of Times a Homeowner Can Use the Special Rules. Homeowners who are over 55 or severely disabled could use the special rules three times in their lifetime. Narrows the Special Rules for Inherited Properties. Starting February 16, 2021, the measure narrows the special rules for inherited properties. Specifically, the measure: \u2022 Ends Special Rules for Properties Not Used as a Home or for Farming. The special rules would apply only to two kinds of inherited property. First, the rules would apply to properties used as a primary home by the child or grandchild. Second, the rules would apply to farms. Properties used for other purposes could no longer use the special rules. \u2022 Requires Tax Bill to Go Up for High Value Inherited Homes and Farms. The property tax bill for an inherited home or farm would go up if the price the property could be sold for exceeds the property's taxable value by more than $1 million (adjusted 40 | Analysis for inflation every two years). In this case, the tax bill would go up but not as much as it would if the property were sold to someone else. Dedicates Certain Money for Fire Protection. The measure could make new funding available to the state. We discuss this new funding in the next section. The measure requires that most of the new funds be spent on fire protection. In addition, the measure requires that a smaller part of the new funds be given to certain local governments. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nIncreased Property Taxes From Narrowed Rules for Inherited Properties. Narrowing the special rules for inherited properties would lead to higher property taxes for some inherited properties. This would increase property taxes for local governments and schools. Reduced Property Taxes From Expanded Rules for Eligible Homeowners. Expanding the special rules for eligible homeowners could change property tax collections in a few ways. Most importantly, more homeowners could get property tax savings when moving from one home to another. This would reduce property taxes for local governments and schools. Overall, More Property Taxes for Local Governments and Schools. Some parts of the measure would increase property taxes. Other parts would decrease them. Overall, property taxes for local governments and schools probably would increase. In the first few years, local governments could gain tens of millions of dollars per year. Over time, these revenue gains could grow to a few hundred million dollars per year. Schools could receive similar property tax gains. Possible Reduction in State Costs for Schools in Some Years. In limited situations, total school funding from property taxes and state taxes could be about the same in some years despite schools' property tax gains. This is because existing state law could cause state funding for schools to decrease by about the same amount as their property tax gains. If this happens, the state would get cost savings in those years. These savings would be a similar amount to school property tax gains. The measure says most of these savings would have to be spent on fire protection. Other Smaller Changes in Tax Collections. The measure allows more people to buy and sell homes without facing an increased property tax bill. Because of this, the measure probably would increase the number of homes sold each year. This would increase money going CHANGES CERTAIN PROPERTY TAX RULES. PROPOSITION LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. 19 to the state and local governments from a number of other taxes collected on the sale of a home. These increases could be in the tens of millions of dollars per year. The measure says most of this increase in state tax revenue would have to be spent on fire protection. Higher Costs for Counties. Counties probably would need to hire new staff and make computer upgrades to carry out the measure. This would increase costs for counties by tens of millions of dollars per year.", "proposal_id": "06a826ab-11c7-485e-83ab-f203d52f36b1.txt"}
{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: COURT CONSOLIDATION\n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\nCOURT CONSOLIDATION. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. \u2022 Amends Constitution to delete references to the municipal courts. These references are now obsolete due to the consolidation of superior and municipal trial courts into unified superior courts previously approved by voters. \u2022 Deletes from Constitution the provisions providing for municipal courts in each county and vesting judicial power of the state in municipal courts. \u2022 Makes certain conforming and related changes in Constitution to reflect consolidation. \u2022 Provides that the constitutional provision governing the transition process to a unified superior court will be automatically repealed on January 1, 2007. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 No additional cost to state or local government.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIn 1998, California voters approved Proposition 220, which permitted superior and municipal courts, known as \"trial courts,\" within a county to consolidate their operations if approved by a majority vote of the superior court judges and municipal court judges in the county. Under consolidation, the superior court assumes jurisdiction over all matters handled previously by superior and municipal courts; municipal court judges become superior court judges and the municipal courts are abolished. All 58 California counties have since voted to consolidate their trial court operations. At the request of the Legislature, the California Law Revision Commission has made recommendations on repealing statutes that are obsolete because of trial court reforms, including those resulting from court consolidation. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nThis measure makes technical and conforming changes to the Constitution recommended by the California Law Revision Commission related to court consolidation. Specifically, the measure deletes obsolete provisions relating to the creation of municipal courts, eligibility requirements for municipal court judges, and the consolidation of municipal and superior courts. As regards the consolidation of municipal and superior courts, constitutional provisions relating specifically to the transition period will be repealed effective January 1, 2007. Finally, the makes conforming changes to the measure Constitution with respect to the membership of superior court judges on the California Judicial Council and the membership of the Commission on Judicial Performance. The California Judicial Council oversees and administers the trial courts. The Commission on Judicial Performance handles complaints against judges. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nThis measure would not result in additional costs to state or local government. \n\nARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 48\n\nThis is a non-controversial change that updates the California Constitution. It passed each house of the Legislature unanimously.  Currently the state Constitution provides for two types of trial courts, superior and municipal courts, in each county. But due to unification of the trial courts, there are no longer any municipal courts in California. However, the California Constitution still contains provisions dealing with municipal courts. These provisions are obsolete and need to be removed.\nThis proposition deletes these obsolete municipal court references from the California Constitution.\nThe proposition implements recommendations of the California Law Revision Commission, which was directed by law to recommend repeal of provisions that have become obsolete because of trial court unification. HOWARD WAYNE, Assembly Member 78th District\n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 48 \n\nLOST \"CHECKS AND BALANCES\" As we explain in our main ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 48 on the next page, removing all references in the California Constitution to \"municipal courts\" removes the possibility that the State Legislature or individual counties will ever re-establish a two-tier trial court system with its \"checks and balances.\" \u2605 *16* UN-ELECTED JUDGES Not many years ago, many \u201cjustice court\" and \"municipal court\" judges were elected by districts within counties. Under consolidation, all local judges are elected on a county-wide basis and are seldom challenged. As a result, the incumbents routinely win by default, and their names do not even appear on the ballot. Under consolidation, the local judiciary has become more insular. WHAT KEEPS JUDGES IN LINE? Without the prospect of an election challenge, judges are restricted only by (1) their own integrity and diligence, (2) some chance of reversal by an appellate court in individual cases, (3) the workings or non- workings of something called the \"Commission on Judicial Performance,\u201d and (4) if a crime is involved, the vigilance of prosecutors-especially the elected California Attorney General. Based on our experience, we think the vast majority of California trial court judges are great; however, we need a system that makes every trial court judge accountable for following the law. Eliminating any chance of re- establishing municipal courts is a step in the wrong direction. For more information, please see www.VoterInformationAlliance.org. GARY B. WESLEY Attorney at Law MELVIN L. EMERICH Attorney at Law  \n\nARGUMENT Against Proposition 48 \n\nIn this measure, the State Legislature is proposing that we permanently delete from the California Constitution any provision for \"municipal courts.\" The main drawback to the proposal is that it would preclude the re-establishment of municipal courts in any of California's 58 counties. Why might a county want to re-establish a \u201cmunicipal court\" below its \"superior court\"? One reason might be to save money. Superior Court Judges are paid more. An even more important reason, though, is that some counties (or even the State Legislature sometime in the future) realize that having all of the trial court judges in may a county part of the same \"superior court\" creates at least the appearance of unfairness. Allow us to explain. Trial courts handle two kinds of cases that have been particularly affected by the \"consolidation\" of the municipal and superior courts in the 58 counties. The first kind of case involves a criminal charge lodged by a local or state prosecutor. A criminal charge may be a \"felony\" or a less-serious \"misdemeanor.\" Both kinds of criminal charges potentially call for examination of the case by two or more judges. A felony case is initiated by the filing of a charge which is presented either to a local criminal grand jury or, in over 95% of the cases, to a local judge sitting as a \"magistrate.\u201d If the grand jury or magistrate decides that the prosecutor has presented enough evidence of guilt (i.e., probable cause) to justify a trial, the prosecutor is authorized to proceed to trial. At that point, the decision to allow the prosecutor to proceed may be challenged by the accused. Here we encounter a problem created by court consolidation. The judge who will hear the challenge will almost always be a judge in the very same court as the judge whose decision is being challenged! A misdemeanor case is ordinarily set for trial without any hearing to determine whether a trial appears justified. If you are convicted in a misdemeanor trial, you may appeal; however, the appeal is decided by a panel of 3 judges from the very same \"superior court\" in which you would have already been convicted! Finally, a civil case which seeks $25,000 or less is called a \"limited jurisdiction case.\" An appeal from a judgment in such a case, once again, is decided by a panel of 3 judges from the very same \"superior court\" in which you would have lost the case! The basis for seeking review of what a judge has done in a case is that the judge ruled or acted wrongly. A one-court system which asks judges of the very same court to correct or rebuke their colleagues creates at least the appearance of unfairness.Separate municipal and superior courts in the counties offered more \"checks and balances\" than the consolidated superior courts which have now been established. Some counties (or the State Legislature) may wish, in the future, to return to the former system. For these reasons, we recommend that voters not permanently delete \"municipal courts\" from the California Constitution.\n GARY B. WESLEY, Co-Chair Voter Information Alliance (VIA) MELVIN L. ERICH, Co-Chair Voter Information Alliance (VIA)\n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 48\n\nIn 1998 the voters of California overwhelmingly approved Proposition 220 to authorize the elimination of the municipal courts. Municipal courts have been eliminated in every county, for estimated savings of $23,000,000 a year for the taxpayers. What remains to be done is the removal of obsolete language in the state constitution that references the no longer existing municipal courts. Proposition 48 accomplishes that goal. The argument against Proposition 48 ignores what is before the voters. Instead, it argues for the advantages of having municipal courts. The voters already decided that issue four years ago by passing Proposition 220. It was approved because eliminating municipal courts allows more efficient use of judicial resources and eliminates administrative costs necessary to maintain two separate trial court systems. The ONLY issue before us is, should obsolete provisions of the Constitution be eliminated? The answer is clearly YES. Leaving obsolete references to municipal courts on the books would only clutter the law, while serving no useful purpose. HOWARD WAYNE, Assembly Member 78th District Any necessary improvements to the law regarding review of magistrate decisions that there is sufficient evidence to try a defendant for a crime, or for appeals in misdemeanor and smaller civil cases can be made to the existing appeals court system. It should not be accomplished by re-creating another level of courts that the public has already voted to eliminate. Proposition 48 would prune deadwood from the California Constitution. Obsolete language unnecessarily complicates the law. Vote YES on Proposition 48. DAVID HUEBNER, Chair California Law Revision Commission", "proposal_id": "c263177d-266f-4980-afd9-a89d7d3a5f18.txt"}
{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: Murder. BART and CSU Peace Officers. \n\nOfficial Title and Summary Prepared by the Attorney General MURDER. BART AND CSU PEACE OFFICERS. LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE AMENDMENT. \u2022 Existing law provides that the punishment for the murder in the second degree of specified peace officers is life without the possibility of parole if the crime occurs while the officer is on duty and aggravating factors are present. This measure specifies these enhanced sentence provisions would also apply when the victim is a peace officer employed by the Bay Area Rapid Transit District or the California State University System. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 Unknown, probably minor, additional state costs.\n\nBackground\n\nUnder California law, there are two \u201cdegrees\" of murder. First degree murder is generally defined as murder that is intentional or deliberate, or that takes place during certain other crimes, including arson, rape, or robbery. It is generally punishable by a sentence of 25 years to life imprisonment with the possibility of release from prison on parole. All other types of murder are second degree murder. Second degree murder is generally punishable by imprisonment for 15 years to life with the possibility of release from prison on parole. An exception is provided in some cases involving the second degree murder of specific peace officers identified in state law, including county sheriffs and city police officers, and various state law enforcement personnel. Specifically, state law provides that if one of these specified peace officers is killed in the line of duty and the person convicted of the second degree murder knew or should have known that the victim was a peace officer, the crime is punishable by a prison term of 25 years to life with the possibility of release from prison on parole. State law also provides that the second degree murder of a specified peace officer is punishable by a longer term of life in prison without the possibility of parole if it is also found that the murderer specifically intended to kill or greatly injure the peace officer, or used a firearm or other dangerous weapon in the crime. \n\nProposal\n\nThis measure requires longer prison sentences for offenders convicted of the second degree murder of law enforcement personnel working for the California State University system and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) District, consistent with penalties now provided for cases involving the murder of other specified peace officers in California. It would add peace officers working for these two public employers to the list of peace officers for whom a conviction for their second degree murder would result in a punishment of 25 years to life or, under certain circumstances, life imprisonment without possibility of parole. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nThis proposition would increase state costs primarily as a result of longer prison terms for the murderers who would receive a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Also, there could be increased state costs for appeals of sentences of life without the possibility of parole. These costs are unknown, but probably minor, because relatively few offenders are likely to be affected by this measure. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 19\n\nIn 1998 the voters of California overwhelmingly approved Proposition 222 which enhanced criminal sentences for persons convicted of murdering police officers under specified circumstances. In approving this proposition, by a vote of 77% in favor to 23% opposed, the citizens of California recognized that police officers face day-to-day hazards in protecting us against harm and enforcing the law that make them vulnerable to serious injury and death. Existing law acknowledges these dangers by providing increased protections against the murder of police officers. Later in 1998, the state legislature passed Senate Bill 1690 which amends this initiative statute, subject to voter approval, to ensure that these same protections are applied to police officers of the California State University (CSU) and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART). The legislature recognized that the officers of these full-service police departments handle the same types and variety of criminal investigations—from petty theft to murder—as their city, county and state counterparts, and as such, assume the same daily life and death risks. The Senate passed Senate Bill 1690 on a vote of 36–0, the Assembly voted 70–3 in favor of the proposal, and the Governor promptly signed the bill into law. Proposition 19 asks the voters of California to approve this legislative action which would provide the same protection against the murder of CSU and BART police, as municipal police, county sheriffs and the police of the University of California currently enjoy. RICHARD RAINEY State Senator, 7th Senatorial District THOMAS M. BLALOCK Vice President, BART Board of Directors \n\nRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 19 \n\nWait just a minute! Proposition 19 does a lot more than just cover penalties for murdering police officers. Proponents are saying this just extends Proposition 222 from the last election. But Proposition 19 also covers: a. falsely reporting a bomb threat to BART police and university police; b. falsely reporting any crime to BART police and university police; c. falsely identifying yourself to BART police and university police to evade proper investigation by the officer; d. joining a posse to catch criminals, when told to do so by BART police and university police; and e. exempting retired BART police and university police officers from prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons. Voters need to decide if they want all these provisions to be adopted. As a matter of fact, we agree with most of Proposition 19\u2014all except the item labeled (d) above. We should pause at giving more officers the power to FORCE average citizens to join a posse to catch dangerous criminals. We would repeal the law giving any officers this power, rather than expanding it. Often much of a law sounds good, but there is a \"poison pill\" that should cause voters to say NO. Three Assemblymen whose records show strong support of law enforcement voted against putting Proposition 19 on the ballot. We agree with them and urge you to vote NO. GAIL K. LIGHTFOOT Past Chair, Libertarian Party of California LARRY HINES Legal Secretary TED BROWN Insurance Adjuster/Investigator \n\nArgument Against Proposition 19 \n\nCalifornia, 1885: The Sheriff says, \"OK, men, let's get the posse together and ride out of town. There are two gunslingers hiding out in the desert and we're going to bring them in.\u201d California, 2000: The BART train officer says, \"OK, train riders, you're now a posse. If you don't help me capture the crazed gunman in the next car, I can arrest YOU and have you fined $1000!\" We thought that posses went out a hundred years ago. But Proposition 19 will expand the power of government so that police on BART trains and at college campuses can force people to help capture criminals-without arms, training or pay. Don't want to help? Well, you could be fined $1000! Most of Proposition 19 is reasonable. Indeed, BART police, University of California police and California State University police should be treated the same as other police officers. But some existing police powers should be ended rather than extended. There's nothing wrong with a voluntary posse. An officer can ask for help, and should do so if he needs it. But to force a random citizen to help with possibly dangerous police work is downright crazy. \n\nIn the Wild West days, most men carried firearms and knew how to use them. So when the sheriff asked for volunteers, he could be sure the men were able to help. Now it's policy for local sheriffs and police chiefs to refuse to issue permits for concealed weapons-except for prominent, politically well-connected individuals. Any citizen who is not a violent felon or a mental patient should be issued a permit. We all have a 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms for self-defense. Proposition 19 also gives off-duty and retired BART and university police the right to carry concealed weapons. This is fine. But why not recognize this right for the rest of us as well? Shouldn't teachers, grocery clerks, dentists and plumbers have the same right and ability to defend themselves? Please vote No on Proposition 19. GAIL K. LIGHTFOOT Past Chair, Libertarian Party of California TED BROWN Insurance Adjuster/Investigator LARRY HINES Legal Secretary \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 19\n\nThose making the argument against Proposition 19 apparently do not understand its provisions. Proposition 19 has absolutely nothing to do with expanding police powers to form a posse or carry concealed weapons when off duty. Police officers throughout the state, including CSU and BART police, already have that authority. Proposition 19 simply asks the voters of California to approve a portion of a bill, passed by the legislature with bi-partisan support in 1998, that makes the murder of CSU and BART police subject to the same penalties as the murder of other police officers. The Legislature recognized that CSU police and BART police face the same day-to-day dangers as other police officers, and overwhelmingly approved this amendment. There was no opposition to this proposal as it passed through the legislative process. In fact, even the position argument above supports this proposition; it states, \"Indeed, BART police, University of California police and California State University police should be treated the same as other police officers.\" Proposition 19 accomplishes just that purpose. It amends Section 190 of the Penal Code to make enhanced sentences for second degree murder of California police officers throughout the state apply equally for second degree murder of CSU and BART police officers. Please vote YES on Proposition 19.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: Elections. Term Limit Declarations for Congressional Candidates. \n\nOfficial Title and Summary Prepared by the Attorney General\u2022 Permits congressional candidates to voluntarily sign non-binding declaration of intention to serve no more than three terms in House of Representatives or two terms in the United States Senate. Requires placement of information on ballots and state-sponsored voter education materials when authorized by candidates. \u2022 Candidates may appear on official ballot without submitting declaration. \u2022 Declaration by winning candidate applies to future elections for same office. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 Unknown, but probably not significant, election costs to the state and counties. \n\nBackground\n\nThe Congress of the United States consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. California's delegation to Congress consists of two senators and 52 representatives. Senators are elected for a term of six years and representatives are elected for a term of two years. The United States Constitution sets the general qualifications and duties of Members of Congress. Federal law does not limit the number of terms a person may be elected to serve as a senator or representative in Congress. In 1992, California voters adopted Proposition 164, which established term limits for California's senators and representatives in Congress. However, Proposition 164 is not likely to go into effect. This is because the United States Supreme Court ruled, in a case involving similar limits established by other states, that the qualifications of office for federal elective officials may be changed only by an amendment to the United States Constitution. Under current state law, the California Secretary of State processes information from candidates who wish to run for office, including declarations of their candidacy. County elections officials are responsible for preparing the content of the ballots for all candidates running for office.  \n\nProposal\n\nThis measure allows all candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives from California to sign a declaration saying that, if elected, they either will or will not voluntarily limit their years of service. Candidates who agree to term limits would indicate that they will voluntarily serve no more than two terms in the Senate (or 12 years) or three terms in the House of Representatives (or 6 years). In addition, a candidate can ask the Secretary of State to place on election ballots a statement that the candidate either did or did not sign such a declaration to voluntarily limit his or her terms of service. The measure does not require a candidate to sign any declaration, nor does it require him or her to ask the Secretary of State to provide information regarding the declarations on the ballot. Fiscal Effect This measure would result in additional election costs to the state and counties. The amount of the additional cost is unknown, but probably not significant. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 27\n\nVote YES on Proposition 27. Term Limits. Term limits on our state legislature are a great success-bringing new people and new ideas to Sacramento. Gone are much of the partisan bickering and backroom deals. Legislators spend their time getting things done for the people, instead of picking fights to score political points. A YES vote on Proposition 27 will help us bring new people and new ideas to Congress. When those who represent us serve for short periods of time, they stay connected to their communities and serve the public interest. Term limits help block the corruption and arrogance that comes from career politicians who are more concerned with their perks and privileges than with what's best for the people. No wonder recent Field polls show that Californians support term limits by almost 3 to 1. The lobbyists and big special interests don't like term limits, but we know our California legislature is doing a much better job now. Californians overwhelmingly support term limits on Congress too, but career politicians in Washington have ignored our votes. That's why it's still politics-as-usual in our nation's capitol. Recently Congress gave themselves yet another pay raise even though 80 percent of Americans opposed it. When it comes to issues we care about, Congress continues to do the bidding of the big special interests. They have refused to reform the election process, and thus 98.5 percent of incumbents won re-election in 1998. The longer politicians spend in Washington, the less they represent us and the more they represent the special interests, the party bosses and their own career interests. But it doesn't have to be that way. The answer is to send citizen legislators-not career politicians-to represent us in Congress. When congressional candidates ask for our vote, we deserve to know whether they're looking to spend a lifetime in Washington as professional politicians or limited terms as public servants. Proposition 27 allows candidates to tell us on the record. A YES vote on Proposition 27 gives you important term limits information about candidates for Congress. \u2022 Term limits are a great success for our state legislature. \u2022 But we still have too many career politicians in Washington. \u2022 As voters, we deserve to know whether a candidate will be a career politician or a citizen legislator. That gives us a real choice about who will represent us in the U.S. Congress. Proposition 27 is a simple way to allow candidates to make their intentions clear. Do they want to represent us in Congress for a short period of public service or are they going to cash in on political careers? As voters, we deserve to know. Proposition 27 tells us. VOTE YES on PROPOSITION 27. TERM LIMITS. GEORGE E. MARTINEZ Community Activist SALLY REED IMPASTATO Proponent, California Term Limit Committee LEWIS K. UHLER President, National Tax Limitation Committee\n\nRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 27 \n\nYes, we agree, the current system is broken. We wish their fantasy of citizen legislators would work, but it won't. It makes it worse for Californians. Here's why: SENIORITY IS NEEDED FOR FEDERAL MONEYS This initiative means that California's Congressional Representatives will never achieve enough seniority in Congress to Chair the Committees that direct Federal Spending. California's Federal tax dollars will be spent in other States. CALIFORNIA'S SHARE WILL GO TO GEORGIA AND TEXAS Our share of moneys for:  \u2022 Schools \u2022 Police \u2022 Seniors \u2022 New Freeways, and \u2022 Safe Drinking Water will go to other States without term limits and with long term legislators, costing California jobs. CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES WILL BE HURT In the next economic downturn California will suffer disproportionately hard. Less Federal dollars means higher crime, more homelessness, less for seniors, less police, and less dollars for schools. WE ARE ALMOST THERE IN VOTING DOWN THESE DANGEROUS IDEAS The last time Californians got to vote on term limits it was almost defeated. This proposal is much worse and more dangerous for California's economy. Vote it down. Let's not send our money to Georgia and Texas. Keep our money here. TERM LIMITS AREN'T WORKING The current term limit system is not working in California. Turnover is the problem. If it wasn't for our moderate Governor, the average citizen's pocketbook would be in real trouble. FOR OVER 200 YEARS WE HAVE CHANGED PEOPLE IN OFFICE THROUGH ELECTIONS, NOT ARBITRARY RULES. VOTE NO TO SAVE CALIFORNIA'S VOTING RIGHTS AND POWER IN CONGRESS! MARK WHISLER President, Sacramento City Taxpayers' Rights League \n\nArgument Against Proposition 27 \n\nTERM LIMITS ARE PURE FOLLY. Term Limits are pure folly, passed for self serving Corporations at our expense. Since term limits were enacted in California we have seen a steady rise in the power of corporate paid lobbyists to get their pork barrel bills through the Legislature. If this year's Legislature doesn't support their giveaway plans, Corporations just wait for next year's Legislature. Politicians now need Corporate campaign money more than ever. LABELS ARE DIVISIVE AND DANGEROUS Let's not get started labeling our politicians. EVERY GROUP will want their label (look at our license plates). Do we really want to see \"supports gray whales\", \"supports midnight basketball in schools\", or \"supports keeping abortions\". Let's not make our voting ONLY about issues selected by others. Let's not cloud our ballot with emotionally charged labels. How will Californian's be able to elect moderate centrist consensus builders if every candidate is labeled by divisive issues to get elected? We won't! SENIORITY Congress still runs on a seniority system. If California's representatives can only stay 6 years the money, jobs, and benefits will flow to other states with long term representatives. That's how the system works. Voting yes will be bad for California's economy. LOBBYISTS FIX BILLS TO GET TAX DOLLARS FOR THEIR CORPORATE CLIENTS. Corporate lobbyists roam the US Capitol halls seeking tax breaks, reduced environmental responsibilities, lower employee benefit requirements, and other bills that are outright gifts to greedy Corporations. Under term limits, Corporate political campaign funds, more than ever, will decide who wins elections. \n\nIf this passes, Corporations will have a stronger grip on our Congress, as they already do with our State Legislature. CALIFORNIA HAS NEEDS FOR ITS OWN CITIZENS AND CHILDREN. California needs to devote its limited tax revenues to schools, roads, bridges, parks, libraries, and police services (to name a few). Our taxes should not be spent bailing out wealthy corporations. Don't be fooled. Voters have proven time and again they know when to vote NO, and this is one of them. YOU DON'T NEED TERM LIMITS. YOU CAN THROW THE \"BUMS\" OUT NOW. Resist the urge to use term limits to \"throw the bums out.\" If your elected officials are bums, vote them out. The current system may be weak, but term limits will replace our Congress with unelected, powerful, hidden self-interest groups. California has numerous problems that our collective wisdom and community spirit can solve. A Legislature or Congress, sold to the highest bidder every two years, is not the answer. We need educated Legislators who understand the complexities and nuances of issues. They are our best choice for meaningful solutions, not on-the-job trainees with short term fixes. DON'T LEGISLATE THOUGHT POLICE. This initiative demonizes politicians who favor a long term rational approach to solving our problems. It goes too_far. Please read the initiative and you'll see why to vote NO. This law is wrong for California. SAY NO TO THE CORPORATIONS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS. VOTE NO ON PROPOSITION 27 MARK WHISLER President, Sacramento City Taxpayers' Rights League \n\nRebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 27 \n\nDON'T LET THEM DESTROY OUR VOTE FOR TERM LIMITS ON THE LEGISLATURE-OR IGNORE OUR VOTE FOR CONGRESSIONAL TERM LIMITS. VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION 27. The Sacramento-based opponent to Proposition 27 attacks the people of California for passing term limits on our state legislators. Where has he been living? Even those who at first opposed term limits now admit that it has worked, bringing new people with new ideas into public service. Special interests are angry that they've lost control over our elected representatives. Good! Term-limited officials stay connected to the communities they serve, not the power-broker's in the Capitol. Under term limits, our legislature passed the largest tax cut in a generation. Instead of never-ending political bickering, the legislature passed the budget on time for the first time in over a decade. Term limits work. TERM LIMITS HAVE HELPED OUR LEGISLATURE STAY CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE. VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION 27. The contributor list AGAINST term limits reads like a who's who of powerful lobbyists, big special interests and well-connected corporations. The largest contributors have been big tobacco companies. Special interests want a government they control-at your expense. LOBBYISTS, BIG SPECIAL INTERESTS & POLITICALLY- CONNECTED CORPORATIONS HATE TERM LIMITS. A whopping 86 percent of lobbyists oppose term limits! These powerful interests get special favors from the career politicians in Congress. We have a right to representatives who represent us.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: LOTTERIES. CHARITABLE RAFFLES.\n\nOfficial Title and Summary Prepared by the Attorney General LOTTERIES. CHARITABLE RAFFLES. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. \u2022 Modifies current constitutional prohibition against private lotteries to permit legislative authorization of raffles conducted by eligible private nonprofit organizations for the purpose of funding beneficial and charitable works. \u2022Requires at least 90% of a raffle's gross receipts to go directly to beneficial or charitable purposes in California, but permits this percentage to be later amended by statute passed by two-thirds vote of each house without voter approval. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022Probably no significant fiscal impact on state and local governments.\n\nBackground\n\nA lottery is a game where a person pays for a chance to win a prize. The State Constitution authorizes the California State Lottery, but prohibits any other lottery. (Under federal law, however, Indian tribes can negotiate with the state to operate lotteries on tribal lands.) Raffles are often held by charitable groups and usually involve the selling of tickets for a chance to win prizes. (\"Door prizes\" are a common form of raffle.) Raffles that require payment for a chance to win a prize are a form of lottery and, thus, are illegal under state law. a Charitable Gambling in California. Charitable gambling serves as fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations. In California, bingo is the only legal gambling activity for charity fund-raising. Organizations operating bingo games must do so in keeping with state and local laws. In general, these laws specify when, where, and at what times bingo games can be operated. \n\nProposal\n\nThis proposition amends the State Constitution to allow private nonprofit groups to conduct raffles under certain conditions. To qualify, at least 90 percent of the gross receipts from the raffle must go directly to charitable purposes in California. (This percentage could be changed with a two-thirds vote of the Legislature and approval by the Governor.) Also, the proposition specifies P2000 that any person who receives compensation in connection with the operation of a raffle must be an employee of the organization conducting the raffle. Raffles could not be conducted unless a law is subsequently adopted specifically authorizing these charitable raffles. The law could also (1) define which organizations were eligible to conduct such raffles and (2) provide for \"reasonable regulation\" of these raffles, including regulatory fees. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nThis proposition would only have a fiscal impact on the state or local governments if these raffles are subsequently authorized by law. If that occurs, the proposition would have some\u2014mainly indirect-effects on state and local revenues. For instance, if the level of gambling on raffles grew significantly, that might reduce other types of gambling\u2014such as the State Lottery and horse racing. These types of gambling are taxed by the state, so revenues could decline somewhat. At least in the near term, however, we estimate that the proposition would not have a significant state or local impact on governmental revenues. In addition, the state could require regulation of these raffles. These costs, which would not be significant, could be paid for by regulatory fees. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 17 \n\nMost Californians are familiar with raffles. Our children sell tickets to raise money for sports leagues, historical societies raffle items to preserve historically significant sites, churches raffle prizes to support their congregations, parent groups hold raffles to support their children's schools. Many of these harmless activities violate the California Penal Code and State Constitution prohibition on raffles. In fact, any person or organization that conducts a traditional raffle commits a misdemeanor crime, punishable by up to six months in jail. Only the State of California raffle, which is better known as the State Lottery, is exempt from the ban. When local police or prosecutors have knowledge of a charitable raffle, they are placed in the position of either shutting down a legitimate, albeit illegal fundraiser, or \"looking the other way\" and not enforcing the criminal law. This is an unworkable and unfair situation, which hurts legitimate charities and invites law enforcement to play favorites. Both of these concerns will be corrected by Proposition 17. If a majority of the voters approve Proposition 17, the ban on raffles by charitable nonprofit organizations will be removed from the State Constitution. Once that happens, the State Legislature will be able to change the Penal Code so that charitable nonprofit organizations will be able to legally conduct a fundraising raffle. The legislation to remove the charitable raffle ban from the Penal Code and regulate their conduct (Senate Bill 639) has been introduced and is being held in the State Legislature pending this vote by the People. Only charitable non-profits will be able to use raffles as a legal fundraiser if Proposition 17 passes. The types of charities that will benefit from this proposition include those that raise money for scholarships, medicine and health, parks and wildlife preserves, libraries, food banks, religious organizations, and art. No commercial raffling would be allowed. Major non-profit organizations in California, as well as law enforcement leaders and organizations back Proposition 17. Some of those groups include the California Association of Nonprofits, the California Broadcasters Association, the California District Attorneys Association, California Literacy, the California State Sheriffs Association, the John XXIII AIDS Ministry, and the State Humane Association of California. The time has come to legalize well-meaning charitable raffles for California non-profit organizations. Vote \"yes\" on Proposition 17. BRUCE MCPHERSON State Senator, 15th District DEAN D. FLIPPO District Attorney, County of Monterey FLORENCE L. GREEN Executive Director, California Association of Nonprofits\n\nRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 17 \n\nWe teach our children that there is a RIGHT WAY and a WRONG WAY to do everything. The same is true with ideas for new laws. Proposition 17 is the WRONG WAY to operate charitable raffles and lotteries. Proposition 17 is a professional gambling operator's dream hiding behind an ill-conceived \"law and order\" smoke screen. For more than a decade, special interests have repeatedly attempted to muscle this scheme through the Legislature and onto the ballot. This year the special interests won with the politicians, placing Proposition 17 on the ballot. DON'T BELIEVE promises of future legislation to regulate raffles. The politicians could have done that a year ago, but DIDN'T. And they WON'T. Protections and controls ARE NOT in Proposition 17. Proposition 17 allows PHONY charities, scams and swindles to EXPLOIT honest people. Proposition 17 INVITES crime, corruption and money laundering to our state. Proposition 17 HURTS legitimate charities and will siphon big money into the pockets of professional gambling operators. Don't believe claims that charitable raffles are against the law. CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE RULED EXISTING LEGITIMATE CHARITABLE RAFFLES AND \"CASINO NIGHTS\" ARE LEGAL. There is no need to FIX what ISN'T broken. California's laws on raffles and lotteries work as well today as they have for the last 100 years. DON'T INVITE CRIME TO CALIFORNIA. DON'T HURT CHARITIES. VOTE \"NO\" on Proposition 17. It is a dangerous scheme that will HURT charities. SENATOR DICK MOUNTJOY MELANIE MORGAN Recovering Compulsive Gambler ART CRONEY Executive Director, Committee on Moral Concerns\n\nArgument Against Proposition 17\n\nProposition 17 would allow professional gambling organizations to run private raffles and lotteries. Don't fall for the line that charitable raffles are presently illegal. Our Constitution and the courts have spelled out how to conduct legal charitable raffles. Raffles and casino nights have been legally used by legitimate charities for raising funds for decades. The existing law is over 100 years old. No one has been prosecuted for this beneficial, entertaining method of raising funds to help children, hospitals, libraries, or a multitude of other legitimate charities.  Without limits and regulations, Proposition 17 will create the biggest gambling headache Californians have ever seen. What is now a harmless social activity will be taken over by professional gambling operators. \u2022 Proposition 17 DOES NOT regulate buying or selling tickets by minors. \u2022Proposition 17 DOES NOT require criminal background checks on professional raffle operators. \u2022Proposition 17 DOES NOT require audits to ensure that funds actually go to charities. \u2022Proposition 17 DOES NOT prevent phony charities from selling tickets over the Internet. Proposition 17 DOES NOT prevent private lotteries from being big enough to compete with the State Lottery, diminishing funds for education. \u2022Proposition 17 DOES NOT prevent continuous raffles, without a winner for years. Proposition 17 DOES NOT regulate devices or pre-programmed computers to select winners. \u2022 Proposition 17 DOES NOT regulate raffle advertising. \u2022Proposition 17 DOES NOT ensure that the future holds any promise for meaningful regulation. \u2022Proposition 17 DOES NOT limit the size frequency of raffles or lotteries. Under Proposition 17, unscrupulous persons will move in to create PHONY charities, market tickets statewide for their own personal gain, with only a trickle of money ever reaching legitimate charities. Remember this. There is NO NEED for Proposition 17. Existing raffles are harmless fund-raisers for legitimate charities. They do not cause crime. The purchase of raffle tickets for local charities does not cause gambling addiction. or If Proposition 17 sponsors really cared about legitimate charities, they wouldn't have cleverly written this measure without regulations to prohibit phony charities and scam artists from lining their pockets with donations. Proposition 17 creates problems and solves none. Proposition 17 is a bad bet for California. DON'T BE FOOLED BY PROFESSIONAL GAMBLING OPERATORS. VOTE \"NO\" ON PROPOSITION 17. DICK MOUNTJOY State Senator ART CRONEY Executive Director, Committee on Moral Concerns \n\nRebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 17\n\nThe opposition is making baseless charges to scare voters. These are the facts they do not want you to know: traditional raffles are illegal in California and have been for over 100 years. There are no exceptions. No court or prosecuting agency has ever claimed traditional raffles are legal for California nonprofit charities. Proposition 17 has no effect on the State Lottery. It simply legalizes what occurs every day across this state. In fact, Proposition 17 is supported by public education leaders. Proposition 17 prohibits commercial, for profit, raffles. Ninety percent of the funds raised by the raffle must go toward the charity. Any person paid for conducting the charity raffle must be an employee of the nonprofit. Other regulations governing the conduct of charitable raffles are in the companion bill, Senate Bill 639, which is being held in the Legislature pending this vote. Proposition 17 is not being backed by professional gambling interests. It is supported by law enforcement leaders who are tired of having to shut down legitimate, but illegal, charitable raffles. The drive to legalize charitable raffles has received support from countless diverse charitable nonprofit organizations, education leaders, and religious organizations. These nonprofit organizations provide 50 billion dollars in services to this state and employ 750,000 people. Do not be misled by the \"Committee on Moral Concerns.\" It is time to get rid of this archaic prohibition on charitable raffles.

LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVE AMENDMENT. \u2022 Provides for a sentence of 20 years to life upon conviction of second-degree murder that is committed by intentionally shooting a firearm from a vehicle at another person outside of the vehicle with the intent to inflict great bodily injury. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 Adoption of this measure would result in unknown, but probably not major, increase in state costs. \n\nBackground\n\nUnder California law, there are two \"degrees\" of murder. First degree murder is generally defined as murder which is planned in advance, or which takes place during certain other crimes, including arson, rape, or robbery. Other types of murder are second degree murder. Second degree murder is punishable by imprisonment for 15 years to life with the possibility of parole. \n\nProposal\n\nThis measure increases the penalty for second degree murder resulting from a \"drive-by shooting\" (shooting someone from a motor vehicle) to imprisonment for 20 years to life, instead of 15 years to life, with the possibility of parole.\n\nFiscal Effect \n\nThis measure increases prison sentences for second degree murder resulting from a \"drive-by shooting.\" To the extent these changes result in longer prison terms, there would be increased state costs. These costs are unknown, but probably not major.\n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 179 \n\nOn average a teenager or a child was shot every single day in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles in 1991. There were thousands of drive-by shootings in Los Angeles County alone and hundreds and hundreds more statewide in 1992 and in 1993. The carnage continues today. Drive-by shootings are spilling the blood of innocent victims, especially children, and are spreading clouds of fear over our neighborhoods throughout California. Too many lives have been claimed. We must stop the violence! As a start, last year Governor Wilson sponsored and signed a bill by State Senator Ruben S. Ayala to make it easier to prosecute drive-by killers for first degree murder and to add five years to the murder penalty for the killer's use of a firearm. \u2666 To strengthen the law further, since prosecutors still may not be able to obtain first degree murder convictions against drive-by assassins, we now need to raise the minimum penalty for second degree drive-by murder by five years from 15 years to 20 years.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: AUTHORIZES BONDS TO CONTINUE FUNDING STEM CELL AND OTHER MEDICAL RESEARCH. INITIATIVE STATUTE \n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\n\u2022 Authorizes $5.5 billion in state general obligation bonds to fund grants from the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine to educational, nonprofit, and private entities for: stem cell and other medical research, including training; stem cell therapy development and delivery; research facility construction; and associated administrative expenses. \u2022 Dedicates $1.5 billion to research and therapy for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, epilepsy, and other brain and central nervous system diseases and conditions. \u2022 Appropriates General Fund moneys to pay bond debt service. \u2022 Expands programs promoting stem cell and other medical research, therapy development and delivery, and student and physician training and fellowships. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 Increased state costs to repay bonds estimated at about $260 million per year over the next roughly 30 years. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nResearchers Use Stem Cells to Study and Treat Many Diseases. Stem cells are certain types of cells that exist within humans. Researchers are interested in stem cells for their potential to regenerate cells, tissues, and organs, thereby potentially helping to treat or cure certain diseases. Researchers engaged in \"regenerative medicine\" are focused on addressing many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, HIV/AIDS, stroke, diabetes, and cancer.\nVoters Approved Earlier Stem Cell Ballot Measure. In 2004, voters approved Proposition 71, which added a provision to the State Constitution affirming the right of researchers in California to conduct stem cell research. The measure also created the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), primarily for the purpose of providing grants to universities and other entities in California to support stem cell research, development of new treatments, clinical trials, new research facilities, and other related activities. The measure also established (1) a governing board to adopt CIRM policies and allocate grant funds, (2) three advisory working groups to help guide the governing board on certain matters, and (3) an independent oversight committee to review CIRM's finances.\nMeasure Allowed State to Issue General Obligation Bonds. Proposition 71 allowed the state to sell $3 billion in general obligation bonds, which are a form of borrowing. The state sold the bonds to investors, and the money generated from these sales funded CIRM grants and operations. After selling bonds, the state has been repaying investors with interest over many years. As is typically the case with these kinds of bonds, the state has made most debt payments from the General Fund the state's main operating account, which pays for education, prisons, health care, and other public services. The measure required that a small amount of interest be paid by funds from the bond sales. (For more information on the state's use of bonds, see \"Overview of State Bond Debt\" later in this guide.)\nGrants Have Funded Several Purposes. Figure 1 shows how CIRM has used its grant funding. Funded projects have involved conducting basic science research (such as laboratory research on stem cells), developing potential treatments, and undertaking clinical trials. Grant funds also have supported other activities, including construction of new research facilities and research internships for college students. The University of California has received the greatest amount of grant funding, followed by private nonprofit universities and institutions (such as Stanford University). In addition to receiving a grant from CIRM, many grant recipients receive additional funding from other sources for their projects. Other common fund sources are industry contributions, private donations, and federal grants. Grant Recipients Are Required to Share Invention-Related Income With the State. Some stem cell research can lead to new inventions, including new medical technologies and treatments. Proposition 71 required grant recipients who license or sell their inventions to share a portion of the resulting income with the state. The state's share of the income is deposited into the General Fund and may be used to support any state program. Over the years, CIRM's governing board has developed rules for how income revenue is shared with the state. The state began receiving income from CIRM-funded inventions in 2017. To date, these inventions have provided a total of approximately $350,000 to the state. CIRM Has Spent Nearly All Available Funds. As of June 2020, CIRM had spent most of its Proposition 71 funds. According to CIRM, around $30 million remains available for grants. As it nears the end of its funding, CIRM has been decreasing its staffing. The institute currently employs 35 full-time staff, down from its peak of over 50 full-time staff. It plans to maintain some staff for the next few years as remaining projects are completed. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nAuthorizes New Bonds for Stem Cell Activities.\nProposition 14 allows the state to sell $5.5 billion in general obligation bonds. The bonds primarily would fund additional grants to support research and the development of treatments (including clinical trials) for many diseases. The proposition sets aside at least $1.5 billion specifically to research and develop treatments for diseases affecting the brain and central nervous system (such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). The proposition directs CIRM to allocate a small share of grant funding for training opportunities for students at the California State University and the California Community Colleges, as well as a small share for helping to establish and support facilities focused on research and clinical trials. For some types of grants, CIRM would be required to ensure grant recipients are located across the state and prioritize applicants that offer matching funds. The proposition allows CIRM to spend no more than 7.5 percent of bond funds on its administrative costs. Establishes Certain Rules Relating to the Bonds. The proposition limits the amount of bonds the state could sell to $540 million per year, thereby spreading out bond sales over at least 11 years. For the first five years after the proposition is approved, the state would make interest payments using funds from the bond sales, thereby reducing the amount of bond funding available for research projects. Beginning January 1, 2026, the state would no longer use funds from bond sales to make interest payments. Instead, the state would make remaining debt payments from the General Fund. Makes Numerous Changes to CIRM. Most notably, the proposition makes several changes intended to improve patient access to stem cell treatments. The proposition allows CIRM to hire up to 15 full-time employees specifically for developing policies and programs relating to improving access to and affordability of treatments for patients. (The institute would be allowed up to 70 full-time employees for other operational purposes.) A new advisory working group of experts would support CIRM's governing board in these matters. Further, any invention-related revenue that is deposited into the General Fund would be used to help pay for patients' regenerative medicine treatments. Among various other changes, the proposition also increases the number of members on CIRM's governing board from 29 to 35. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nTotal Estimated State Costs of $7.8 Billion. The cost to repay the bonds authorized by this proposition depends on various factors, such as the interest rates on the bonds and the time period over which they are repaid. We estimate the total cost to pay off the bonds would be $7.8 billion-$5.5 billion for the principal and $2.3 billion for the interest. State costs would average about $260 million per year for about 30 years. This amount is less than 1 percent of the state's current General Fund budget.\nDifficult to Estimate Invention-Related Income Available for Patients' Treatment Costs. The amount of revenue from new inventions that would be available to the state for helping to cover costs for patients' regenerative medicine treatments is uncertain. Many times, research does not lead to an invention. Also, a significant amount of time For the full text of Proposition 14, see page 89. AUTHORIZES BONDS CONTINUING PROPOSITION STEM CELL RESEARCH. INITIATIVE STATUTE. 14 typically passes from starting a research project to licensing or selling an associated invention. To date, the state has collected a few hundred thousand dollars in invention- related income. Past revenue collections, however, might not accurately predict future revenue.\nOther Possible Fiscal Effects. The proposition could result in numerous indirect effects on state and local governments. For example, the proposition were to result in new treatments, state and local government costs for some programs such as Medi-Cal, the state's subsidized health care program for low-income people, could be affected. The net fiscal impact of the indirect effects of this proposition is unknown.", "proposal_id": "19650563-611e-41f6-842d-c6303ff12946.txt"}
{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: California State Lottery. Allocation for Instructional Materials. \n\nOfficial Title and Summary\n\n\u2022 Amends Government Code section 8880.4 which provides that at least 34% of the total annual state lottery revenues shall be allocated to benefit public education. \u2022 Provides that beginning with 1998-99 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, one-half of the amount of the share allocated to public education that exceeds the amount allocated in fiscal year 1997-98 shall be allocated to school and community college districts for the purchase of instructional materials. \u2022 The funds are distributed on the basis of an equal amount per unit of average daily attendance. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 In the near term, tens of millions of dollars in annual lottery revenues that go to public education would be earmarked for instructional materials. Amounts earmarked in future years would depend on changes in the level of overall lottery revenues.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Lottery. Since 1985, the state has operated the California State Lottery. Revenues from the lottery are allocated as follows: \u2022 50 percent is returned to players as prizes. At least 34 percent is allocated to public education. \u2022 A maximum of 16 percent can be used to administer the lottery. The amount allocated to public education is distributed, based on student enrollment, to K-14 public schools (K-12 school districts and community colleges), the California State University, the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, and specific state departments that provide K-14 education programs. As shown in Figure 1, lottery revenues are currently about $2.6 billion a year. The figure also shows how funds are allocated to education. Under existing law, these funds can be used for any school expense (except for buying property, constructing facilities, and financing research).\nInstructional Materials. Local school districts are responsible for providing necessary services and materials such as teachers, facilities, and instructional materials\u2014to educate children. (Instructional materials consist primarily of textbooks and other reading materials, but also include other items such as computer software, arts and crafts supplies, and maps.) The state currently provides schools almost $600 million each year that must be spent on instructional materials. (This is about $100 per student each year.) \n\nProposal\n\nThis proposition changes the way that a portion of the annual lottery revenues is distributed to public education. Basically, of the future growth in lottery funds, one-half must go to K-14 public schools and be spent on instructional materials. (See box for an example of how this would work.) These funds would be allocated to K-14 schools on a per-student basis. \n\nHow the Proposition Would Affect Education Lottery Funds \n\nThe proposition uses fiscal year 1997-98 (that is, July 1, 1997 through June 30, 1998) as the \"base year.\" In that year, the state allocated $780 million in lottery monies to public education. The proposition's impact in any year would depend on the growth in lottery funds since 1997-98. For example, it is estimated that the total 1999-00 allocation to public education will be $867 million. Based on this amount, the formula in the proposition would result in the following: \u2022 Growth: $867 million - $780 million = $87 million. \u2022 Amount Dedicated to Instructional Materials: $87 million x 50 percent = $43.5 million.\nTherefore, under this example, the proposition would result in the allocation of $43.5 million to K-14 public schools for instructional materials. The allocation of the remaining public education lottery funds ($867 million $43.5 million $823.5 million) would not be affected by the proposition. \n\nThe proposition would not change the way \"base\" lottery revenues are allocated to public education. It also would not change the way that the other one-half of growth monies is allocated. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nThis proposition would not affect the total amount of lottery revenues going to public education. As noted above, it would simply earmark a portion of those funds for instructional materials only. In the near term, we estimate this earmarked amount would be in the tens of millions of dollars each year. The annual amount of funds dedicated to instructional materials would depend on changes in the level of overall lottery revenues. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 20 \n\nCalifornia has an alarming textbook shortage. A YES vote for PROPOSITION 20 will guarantee that California's students have a consistent source of funding for textbooks, without increasing taxes or expanding the lottery. When it comes to academic achievement, textbooks are second only to competent teachers. \u2022 California is currently ranked at the bottom, 47th out of the 50 states, in per pupil textbook spending. \u2022 54% of California teachers surveyed say that they do not have enough books for students to take home for homework and test preparation, and nearly 25% of students have to share books in class. \u2022 40% of teachers say that they waste valuable class time doing daily attendance. activities to compensate for the textbook shortage. \u2022 In most California schools, students are unable to take books home to study; often schools only have one set of textbooks to be used by many students. Proposition 20, the CARDENAS TEXTBOOK ACT OF 2000, will guarantee that a portion of lottery revenues are used for the purchase of textbooks and other instructional materials. Currently, 50% of lottery revenues go to prizes; 34% are allocated to the benefit of public education and 16% are used for the payment of administrative expenses and promotions. The education funds can only be spent for instructional purposes. \u2022When the voters approved the Lottery in 1984, the California Department of Education strongly recommended that districts use lottery funds for one-time costs such as textbooks, computers and field trips. \u2022 The Department discouraged the funding of ongoing costs with fluctuating lottery revenues. However, districts continually spend Lottery funds for ongoing costs. \n\nThis Act would create a mechanism to ensure continuous funding for textbooks and instructional materials within the current education lottery revenues. Specifically, Proposition 20 would require that half of any increase in education revenue be reserved for the purchase of textbooks and instructional materials. The 1997\u20131998 fiscal year would serve as the base amount to determine each year's increase. For example, if there were a $100 million difference between education revenues in 1997-1998 and 1998-1999 then $50 million would be dedicated to textbooks and instructional materials. The funds are to be distributed proportionally based on each district's average daily attendance. Proposition 20 would guarantee additional projected revenues of $60 million in fiscal year 1998-1999, $80 million in 1999-2000, and $90 million in 2000-2001 for textbooks and instructional materials. A recent statewide survey indicates that the majority of Californians support increased funding for textbooks. \u2022 72% of Californians believe it is \"important\" or \"very important\" that all California public school students have current textbooks. 65% of Californians believe that the state, not the local governments, should fund the purchase of new textbooks. \u2022 60% believe it is more important to provide funds for current textbooks than to fund class size reduction and new classrooms. A YES vote for PROPOSITION 20 will help ensure that students have the textbooks they need to succeed. We cannot expect students to meet our new high education standards without current materials. TONY CARDENAS California State Assemblymember, 39th District NELL SOTO California State Assemblymember, 61st District\n\nRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 20\nAll school children need up-to-date textbooks and instructional materials. But PROP. 20 is NOT the answer. Prop. 20 IS UNNECESSARY. The California State budget already provides ongoing funding for textbooks. In addition, a new state program is providing $1 billion for textbooks over the next four years. \u2022 Prop. 20 TAKES AWAY LOCAL CONTROL. 42 Presently, the use of the lottery dollars that come to local schools is left to the decision-making of local school boards and allocated for local priorities. Prop. 20 takes away this local control-just one more way for Sacramento politicians and bureaucrats to meddle in local school decision-making. We need less meddling, not more. Prop. 20's MANDATE MAY REDUCE LOCAL SPENDING ON SPECIAL LOCAL PROJECTS. Because lottery funds fluctuate every year, many local districts dedicate these \"unstable\" funds to one-time-only expenditures, like science equipment, special training, emergency repairs, reading workshops, computers, and wiring for computers and other learning technology. Allowing each district to choose what they need most is the best use of lottery funds. We want the best public education we can provide our children. We want SMALLER CLASS SIZES, BETTER FACILITIES, MORE ACCOUNTABILITY and higher TEST SCORES. BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL AND LOCAL DECISION-MAKING about how to achieve those goals. No one knows better what our students need than those closest to them the local teachers, principals, and school boards in their own communities. PROP. 20 TAKES AWAY LOCAL CONTROL. VOTE NO on PROP. 20. WAYNE JOHNSON President, California Teachers Association SANDY CLIFTON President, Association of California School Administrators LESLIE DEMERSSEMAN President, California School Boards Association  \n\nArgument Against Proposition 20\n\n\u2022 This proposition has no merit. It is about state control as opposed to local control. \u2022 School management needs some flexibility to best serve our children. \u2022  School instructional materials are already funded, by several sources, at $542 million. This would add an estimated $15 million in the first year, money more critically needed for school security, safety, and other identified needs. \u2022 Public school funding is already highly restricted as to use, SO restricted, in fact, that school management must shuffle and scrape to fund such necessities as: \u2022 School safety and security \u2022 Expenses for class size reduction  \u2022 Reading Specialists \u2022 Student Counselors \u2022 Outdoor Education \u2022 Needs locally identified \n\nAdditionally, unnecessary detailed state control creates burdensome record keeping and reporting requirements, involving extra employees and wasted expenditures. Who should run our schools, politicians or political appointees in Sacramento, or parents, caring local school boards and school administrators? Who knows best the needs of our children for: \u2022 Security and safety? Protection from drugs while at school? Classroom deficiencies and needs? 20. Proposition 20 handicaps already burdened local administrators, school boards, parents and teachers, adversely affecting our children's safety, health and basic education, and is wasteful of our funds requiring additional employees for burdensome and unnecessary record keeping, planning and reporting. Support local control. Please vote NO on Proposition 20 ASSEMBLYMAN GEORGE R. HOUSE JR. Assembly District 25 ASSEMBLYMAN STEVE BALDWIN Assembly District 77\n\nRebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 20\n\nA YES vote for Proposition 20 will set aside money for textbooks and instructional materials without reducing the amount of lottery money the schools currently receive. It will only affect any GROWTH in lottery revenues for education. A YES vote for Proposition 20 will allow schools to continue to fund everything that they fund now and more. They ma intain LOCAL CONTROL. Proposition 20 would only take HALF OF ANY GROWTH in the lottery revenues and RESERVE it for textbooks and instructional materials. For example, the 1997-1998 fiscal year revenues were about $822 million. The 1998-1999 fiscal year revenues grew by $113 million. Proposition 20 would only reserve half of the growth, $56.5 MILLION, for textbooks and allow the schools to spend the remaining $878.5 MILLION as they wish. We agree that school safety and security are important; the majority of the lottery money will continue to be available for these purposes. But, in educating children, textbooks are ranked second in importance only to teachers. Yet, California's ranking for per pupil textbook spending is at the bottom nationally\u201447th out of 50 states. There remains a major shortage of textbooks statewide, and a continuous need to replace them. Setting aside some lottery revenues for textbooks is essential to enable children to meet the new high education standards and to obtain a quality education. A YES vote on Proposition 20, the Cardenas Textbook Act, will provide LONG-TERM funding without increasing taxes.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: BALLOT MEASURES. APPLICATION. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.\n\nOfficial Title and Summary\n\n\u2022 Prohibits any statewide initiative, legislative measure, or local ballot measure from excluding or including any county, city or other local jurisdiction from its application based upon voter approval or the casting of a specified percentage of votes for or against the measure within that political subdivision. \u2022 Provides that no statewide initiative, legislative measure, or local ballot measure can contain language which enables alternative or cumulative provisions of the measure to become law based upon a specified percentage of votes being cast for or against the measure. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 The number of measures this proposition would affect in the future, and the resulting fiscal impact, cannot be estimated.\n\nBackground\n\nIn addition to voting for candidates for office, Californians vote on a variety of state and local measures-initiatives, referenda, constitutional amendments, bonds, and revisions to local charters. These measures are put before the voters by the state Legislature, local governing bodies (such as city councils and county boards of supervisors), and by individual citizens or groups seeking to change the law. In most cases, these ballot measures apply to all areas within the state or a local community in the same way. For example, if a statewide measure passes, it applies to all counties in the same way, regardless of whether a majority of voters in any individual county approved the measure. One recent measure, however, was different (Proposition 172 on the November 1993 ballot). The measure, which enacted a statewide sales tax increase, provided that the revenues from the tax increase would go only to those counties that voted in favor of the measure. (Absent this vote the county could still receive the funds if the board of supervisors voted to request an allocation.) As a result, some people who otherwise would have voted \"no\" may have voted \"yes\" to ensure that their county received some of the money. In addition, most ballot measures identify a specific policy that would be adopted if the measure passes. A recent local measure, however, contained an unusual provision. It stated that: \u2022 If the measure were approved by a majority of voters, a tax for general purposes would be enacted. \u2022 If, however, two-thirds of the voters approved the measure, a tax for special purposes would be enacted. Thus, a \"yes\" vote could mean two different things. \n\nProposal\n\nThis proposition, a constitutional amendment, prohibits the type of measures discussed above by: \u2022 Requiring state and local ballot measures to apply in the same way in all parts of the jurisdiction (that is, the state or a local government) affected by the measures, regardless of how any individual part of that jurisdiction voted. Thus, a ballot measure could not apply only in those areas that voted in favor of the measure. \u2022 Prohibiting ballot measures from containing alternative or additional provisions that would be enacted depending on the percentage of votes cast in favor of the measure. Thus, a ballot measure could not have one outcome if approved by a majority of voters and a different outcome if approved by a two-thirds vote. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nThere have been only a small number of state and local measures which have used the provisions prohibited by this constitutional amendment. We cannot estimate how many measures to which it would apply in the future or the resulting fiscal effect. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 219 \n\nPROPOSITION 219 STOPS \"BALLOT BOX BLACKMAIL\" BY POLITICIANS! In November 1993 the politicians in the State Legislature placed a measure on the statewide election ballot which raised the sales tax to pay for additional public safety resources. BUT THAT BALLOT MEASURE CONTAINED A PROVISION TO EXTORT VOTERS INTO SUPPORTING IT! The blackmail provision specified that residents of all 58 counties would have to pay the higher tax-but that only those counties which VOTED IN HIKE would be able to receive the new police and fire protection revenues back! That's right. unless your county voted the way the professional politicians wanted, you would pay the higher tax while getting no benefits back! A leading nonpartisan watchdog organization publicly called this cynical tactic \"inherently undemocratic!\" Proposition 219 will STOP POLITICAL BLACKMAIL of this type and make sure it can never happen again! Proposition 219 will PROHIBIT POLITICAL DISCRIMINATION against the residents of a city, county or other local jurisdiction just because they voted for or against a particular ballot measure. Proposition 219 will GUARANTEE BENEFITS of all ballot measures will be provided fairly to the people of every community in California. Proposition 219 will PRESERVE INTEGRITY in our elections. Proposition 219 will PROTECT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS of California voters to cast their ballots without fear of political revenge, intimidation or blackmail.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: Murder: Special Circumstances. \n\nOfficial Title and Summary\n\n\u2022 Amends provisions of Penal Code section 190 defining the special circumstances where first degree murder is punishable by either death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Provides that a special circumstance exists for killings committed \"by means of lying in wait\" rather than \"while lying in wait.\" Provides that a special circumstance exists where murder is committed while the defendant was involved in acts of kidnapping or arson, even if it is proved that the defendant had a specific intent to kill, and the kidnapping or arson was committed to facilitate murder. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 Unknown, probably minor, additional state costs.\n\nBackground\n\nFirst degree murder is generally defined as murder that is intentional or deliberate or that takes place during certain other crimes. It is generally punishable by a sentence of 25 years to life imprisonment with the possibility of release from prison on parole. However, a conviction for first degree murder results in a sentence of death or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the prosecutor charges and the court finds that one or more \"special circumstances\" specified in state law apply to the crime. One such special circumstance involves cases in which the murderer intentionally killed the victim \"while lying in wait.\" The courts have generally interpreted this provision to mean that, in order to qualify as a special circumstance, a murder must have occurred immediately upon a confrontation between the murderer and the victim. The courts have generally interpreted this provision to rule out a finding of a special circumstance if the defendant waited for the victim, captured the victim, transported the victim to another location, and then committed the murder. A special circumstance can also be charged and found if one of a list of specific felonies, including arson and kidnapping, occurred during the commission of a first degree murder. However, the courts have determined that a special circumstance can be found in such a case only when the criminal's primary goal was to commit arson or kidnapping and only later a murder was committed to further the arson or kidnapping. The courts determined that a special circumstance could not be found in a case in which the criminal's primary goal was to kill rather than to commit arson or kidnapping. \n\nProposal\n\nThis measure amends state law so that a case of first degree murder is eligible for a finding of a special circumstance if the murderer intentionally killed the victim \"by means of lying in wait.\" In so doing, this measure replaces the current language establishing a special circumstance for murders committed \"while lying in wait.\" This change would permit the finding of a special circumstance not only in a case in which a murder occurred immediately upon a confrontation between the murderer and the victim, but also in a case in which the murderer waited for the victim, captured the victim, transported the victim to another location, and then committed the murder. This measure also amends state law so that a case of first degree murder is eligible for a finding of a special circumstance if arson or kidnapping was committed to further the murder scheme. As a result of these two changes in state law, additional first degree murderers would be subject to punishment by death or by life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, instead of a maximum prison sentence of 25 years to life. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nThis measure would increase state costs primarily as a result of longer prison terms for the murderers who would receive a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Also, there would be increased state costs for appeals of additional death sentences, which are automatically subject to appeal to the California Supreme Court. The magnitude of these costs is unknown, but is probably minor, because relatively few offenders are likely to be affected by this measure. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 18 \n\nProposition 18 corrects two odd decisions by the Rose Bird Supreme Court. In 1980, and again in 1985, that court turned our voter-enacted death penalty law on its head. In the first case, the court ruled that an estranged husband who arranged the kidnapping of his wife in order to kill her was not subject to the death penalty or even life imprisonment without parole because the kidnapping was committed solely to murder her rather than to commit a less serious crime! In the second case, the court mandated that a criminal who kidnapped and killed a witness to prevent him from testifying was not subject to the death penalty or life without parole. Under these hapless decisions: \u2022 A murderer who deliberately kidnaps his victim to kill him and then takes the victim to a remote location and kills him would not be subject to the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (even though it would be applicable if the kidnapping was committed for some lesser purpose). \u2022 A murderer who sets fire to a building with a premeditated plan to kill someone inside would not be subject to the death penalty or a sentence of life imprisonment without parole (even though it would be applicable if committed only for arson to destroy property that results in an unintended death). Proposition 18 provides voters the chance to correct such unjust, illogical remnants of the Rose Bird court and restore logic, fairness, and justice to our death penalty laws. It grants juries the option of rendering verdicts of death or life imprisonment without parole to those who: \u2022 Kidnap for an express premeditated purpose to murder; \u2022 Lie in wait for their victims, then seize and take them to a more secluded spot to murder them; \u2022 Commit arson for the purpose of killing a person inside the building. It defies reason to exclude such aggravated murders from our death penalty or life imprisonment law. Proposition 18 eliminates unequal treatment from court-imposed law. It restores equal justice for murder victims' families, for law enforcement officers who each day confront criminals and even murderers and for all Californians. Voting \"yes\" on Proposition 18 ensures a rational standard for capital punishment and life imprisonment and protects the honesty and integrity of the law in our state. HON. GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN Former Governor of California HON. MICHAEL D. BRADBURY District Attorney of Ventura County MRS. QUENTIN L. (MARA) KOPP Retired Social Worker \n\nRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 18 \n\nWhat good does it do us to pass Proposition 18, extend capital punishment? We owe it to ourselves to put aside prejudices, assess facts. Nobody's been able to demonstrate statistically that capital punishment deters murders or saves lives. States and nations without capital punishment have lower murder rates. Instead, research demonstrates it costs $2 million more per case to prosecute a murderer through to the death penalty than if the defendant serves for life without possibility of parole. Why don't we get smart, save that money, invest in efforts which could reduce the murder rate, especially against persons in law enforcement? We appreciate our fellow humans who choose careers wherein they put their lives on the line to assure our public safety. And we'd provide them more safety if we devoted the money capital punishment costs to research to prevent future murderers. Capital punishment gives us no way to learn about the root causes of murderous conduct. As we grow to recognize that violence is learned behavior, it's evident we can learn more about their lives, ferret out the root causes of their murders, if these folks are alive. Hopefully, in due time, through sufficient study, we'll learn enough so future children won't grow up so disturbed within themselves, so dangerous to the rest of us! Let's save money, devote it to preventing violence, especially murder. Be smart, join us in voting NO, defeat Proposition 18. AZIM KHAMISA Founder, Tariq Khamisa Foundation WILSON RILES, JR. Executive Director, American Friends Service Committee of Northern California SENATOR JOHN VASCONCELLOS Chair, Senate Public Safety Committee\n\nArgument Against Proposition 18 \n\nAs a taxpayer, you are being asked to enlarge the death penalty. You deserve clear proof that this proposed change would improve public safety and the quality of justice. That proof is lacking. Public safety would not be improved by this proposition. Under existing law, the homicide rate in California has fallen steadily and dramatically since 1991. Yet we still have not matched the success of the states that use no death penalty. Massachusetts, for example, is an urban state with no death penalty and a homicide rate one-third of California's. In fact, states that have no death penalty usually suffer fewer murders in proportion to their population than states that expend resources on capital punishment. Enlarging the death penalty would not make our streets more safe. It costs California taxpayers $2 million over and above the cost of life imprisonment each time a murderer is sent to Death Row. We should be asking some hard questions. Isn't it better to invest this money in after-school programs for youth? Shouldn't schools be funded to train all of their personnel in conflict resolution programs that have been proven effective, and why are only a small fraction of schools able to train parents in these programs? Enlarging the death penalty would not enable us to spend our public safety tax dollars more wisely. The quality of justice would not be improved by this proposition. Adjusting the scope of punishment can never compensate for the harm caused by murder. Any murder is deplorable. The community and family members suffer whenever a life is deliberately cut short, regardless of whether arson, kidnaping, or lying-in-wait is involved. In fact, it trivializes the vast majority of cases to imagine there is any link between the circumstances of a killing, the type of retribution imposed, and the agony of friends and family of the victim. There is no evidence that communities and families of murder victims in California are better able to recover from their loss due to the existence of a death penalty than communities and families in Massachusetts heal in the absence of a death penalty. Enlarging the death penalty would not improve justice for communities and families of victims. The law already allows capital punishment in more homicide cases than prosecutors pursue as death penalty matters. And in cases where they do urge a death sentence, jurors often refuse to recommend it. As a result, most death-eligible cases are resolved by plea bargains. To the extent this proposition would expand the number of death-eligible cases, lawyers would expend extra taxpayer dollars on the plea-bargain process. Added litigation would be of no real assistance to the families of victims, nor to the community. This proposition will not improve public safety or the quality of justice. Vote NO. MOST REVEREND SYLVESTER D. RYAN President, California Catholic Conference MIKE FARRELL President, MJ & E Productions, Inc. SENATOR PATRICK JOHNSTON Chair, Senate Appropriations Committee \n\nRebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 18 \n\nOpposition arguments center almost entirely on philosophical objections to the death penalty but miss the point of this measure, which was approved for the ballot (since it amends an initiative) by huge nonpartisan votes in the Legislature (Senate 28\u20136, Assembly 66-2) to correct bizarre Rose Bird court decisions. Reasons for Proposition 18 Under Rose Bird court decisions: Criminals who kidnap someone to rob them, then kill them as an afterthought or who set fire to a building to destroy property are subject to the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole, at a jury's discretion; Criminals who, however, kidnap someone to murder them or set fire to a building to murder the occupants and do kill them are not subject to a death sentence or life imprisonment without parole. This simply isn't right. Nonpartisan Support Crime victims and law enforcement strongly support Proposition 18. Introduced for the ballot by former Independent State Senator Quentin Kopp, it has been publicly endorsed and/or voted for by Crime Victims United of California, Democratic Governor Gray Davis, Attorney General Bill Lockyer, former Republican Governors George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson, Democratic Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante, Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and Republican Senator Richard Rainey, among others. Opposition arguments almost seem to trivialize murder cases. Their statements ring hollow with actual family and friends of murder victims. For example, training school personnel in \"conflict resolution,\" while commendable, doesn't cure injustices in current murder law. Proposition 18 does. Please vote \u201cyes\u201d.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: Ends Taxation of Certain Food Products. \n\nOfficial Title and Summary\n\n\u2022 Amends Constitution to prohibit state and local governments from imposing sales or use taxes on food products which are exempt from such taxation under existing statutes or this initiative. \u2022 Adds statute exempting candy, bottled water, and snack foods from sales and use taxes. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 Reduces sales and use tax revenue to the state by $210 million in the current year (1992-93) and $330 million annually thereafter. \u2022 Reduces sales and use tax revenue to local governments by $70 million in the current year and $120 million annually thereafter. \n\nBackground\n\nCurrently, a sales and use tax is imposed on most goods purchased in this state. Because there are both state and local government components of this tax, the total sales tax rate varies from county to county. It averages, however, about 8 percent statewide. State law does not allow the sales tax to be imposed on certain items. The tax does not apply, for example, to most food items sold for home consumption. In 1991, however, state law was changed to apply the sales tax to several food items: candy, \"snack food,\" and bottled water. \n\nProposal\n\nThis measure amends the State Constitution so as to prohibit the state, or any county, city, or special district, from imposing sales or use taxes on food products used for home consumption. Thus, the measure places the current statutory exemption for food products (which can be changed by action of the Legislature and the Governor) in the Constitution (which can only be changed by a vote of the people). This measure also changes state law to define candy, snack foods, and bottled water as food products. As a result of this change, the measure exempts these items from the sales tax. As above, a vote of the people would be required to make them taxable. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nFor the current (1992-93) fiscal year, this measure would reduce state government sales and use tax revenues by about $210 million. In addition, it would reduce local government revenue by approximately $70 million. In subsequent years, the total revenue losses would be about $330 million for the state and approximately $120 million for local governments.\n\nArgument in favor of Proposition 163 \n\n\"Proposition 163\" is the Don't Tax Food Initiative. It repeals the sales tax that was placed on food, bottled water, and candy in 1991. We have a proud tradition in California of not taxing the essentials of life. And there is nothing more basic than the food and water we consume in order to survive. Yet a food tax was passed last year. A sales tax is the most regressive levy that places the greatest burden on those who can least afford the tax. And an even worse policy is to place a sales tax on food. This is the first step toward a tax on all food products in California. And the revenue generated for the General Fund is less than one-half of one percent of the overall State Budget. The food tax not only violates a great state tradition, is unfair and cruel, but it is an administrative nightmare. Small pies are taxed-large pies are not. Granola bars are taxed-whole granola is not. Pretzels are taxed-peanuts are not. Bottled water is taxed-tap water is not. This is nonsense. And it ought to be stopped. \"Proposition 163\" stops it. It amends-or changes-the California State Constitution to prohibit forever state and local governments from imposing sales or use taxes on bottled water, candy and food products which are exempt from such taxation under existing statutes. Taxes ought to be fair to all California taxpayers. Taxing food is a bad idea but arbitrarily and confusingly taxing certain foods is even worse. This tax should be dumped. \"Proposition 163\" repeals the food tax. Vote YES on \"Proposition 163.\" RICHARD E. FLOYD Member of the Assembly, 53rd District PETER JENSEN Executive Director Calif.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: ALLOWS DIVERSITY AS A FACTOR IN PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION, AND CONTRACTING DECISIONS. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT \n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\n\u2022 Permits government decision-making policies to consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin to address diversity by repealing article 1, section 31, of the California Constitution, which was added by Proposition 209 in 1996. \u2022 Proposition 209 generally prohibits state and local governments from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to, individuals or groups on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, education, or contracting. \u2022 Does not alter other state and federal laws guaranteeing equal protection and prohibiting unlawful discrimination. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 No direct fiscal effect on state and local entities because the measure does not require any change to current policies or programs. \u2022 Possible fiscal effects would depend on future choices by state and local entities to implement policies or programs that consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, public employment, and public contracting. These fiscal effects are highly uncertain. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nState and Federal Constitutions Require Equal Protection. The state and federal constitutions provide all people equal protection, which generally means that people in similar situations are treated similarly under the law. \n\nIn 1996, California Voters Banned Consideration of Race, Sex, Color, Ethnicity, or National Origin in Public Programs. In 1996, California voters approved Proposition 209, adding a new section to the State Constitution Section 31 of Article I. The new section generally banned the consideration of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public employment, public education, and public contracting in California.\n\nThere Are Some Exceptions to Proposition 209. State and local entities can consider sex when it is necessary as part of normal operations. For example, the state can consider the sex of an employee when staffing specific jobs at state prisons where it is necessary for staff and inmates be the same sex. Additionally, state and local entities may consider specified characteristics when it is required to receive federal funding. For example, the state is required to set goals for the portion of contracts awarded to certain groups for federally funded transportation projects, like businesses owned by women and people of color. \n\nProposition 209 Affected Certain Public Policies and Programs. Before Proposition 209, state and local entities had policies and programs intended to increase opportunities and representation for people who faced inequalities as a result of their race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. These types of programs often are called \"affirmative action\" programs. For example, some of the state's public universities considered race and ethnicity as factors when making admissions decisions and offered programs to support the academic achievement of those students. State and local entities had employment and recruitment policies intended to increase the hiring of people of color and women. The state also established programs to increase the participation of women-owned and minority-owned businesses in public contracts. The state set goals for the portion of state contracts that were awarded to those types of businesses. After voters approved Proposition 209, these policies and programs were dis or modified unless they qualified for one of the exceptions. \n\nFederal Law Allows Policies and Programs That Consider Certain Characteristics, Within Limits. Before Proposition 209, state and local policies and programs that considered race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin still had to comply with federal law. Federal law establishes a right to equal protection and as a result limits the use of these considerations. For example, under federal law, universities may consider these characteristics as one of several factors when making admission decisions in an effort to make their campuses more diverse. To ensure compliance with federal law, these policies and programs must meet certain conditions that limit the consideration of these characteristics. These conditions are intended to prevent discrimination that violates equal protection. State law also has a number of antidiscrimination provisions that are similar to those in federal law. \n\nPolicies and Programs Created or Modified After Proposition 209. After voters approved Proposition 209, some public entities in California created or modified policies and programs to instead consider characteristics not banned by Proposition 209. For example, many of the state's universities provide outreach and support programs for students who are first in their family to attend college. Many university campuses also consider where students attended high school and where they live when making admissions decisions. The universities view these policies and programs as ways to increase diversity without violating Proposition 209.\n\nPROPOSAL\n\nEliminates Ban on the Consideration of Certain Characteristics in Public Education, Public Employment, and Public Contracting. If approved, the measure would repeal Proposition 209-Section 31 of Article I of the California Constitution. This would eliminate the ban on the consideration of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, public employment, and public contracting. As a result, state and local entities could establish a wider range of policies and programs so long as they are consistent with federal and state law related to equal protection. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nNo Direct Fiscal Effects on Public Entities. The measure would have no direct fiscal effect on state and local entities because the measure would not require any change to current policies or programs. Instead, any fiscal effects would depend on future choices by state and local entities to implement policies or programs that consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in public education, public employment, and public contracting. \n\nPotential Fiscal Effects of Implementing Programs Highly Uncertain. State and local entities could make any number of decisions about policies and programs that consider race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin. Because the specific choices state and local entities would make if voters approved this measure are unknown, the potential fiscal effects are highly uncertain.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: Subordinate Judicial Officers. Discipline.\n\nOfficial Title and Summary\n\n\u2022 This measure grants the Commission on Judicial Performance discretionary authority with regard to the oversight and discipline of subordinate judicial officers, subject to California Supreme Court review, according to same standards as judges. \u2022 Provides that no person found unfit to serve as subordinate judicial officer after hearing before Commission shall have status required to serve as subordinate judicial officer. Responsibility of court to initially discipline or dismiss subordinate judicial officer as employee not diminished or eliminated by measure. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: \u2022 Probably minor, if any, state costs for the Commission on Judicial Performance to provide oversight and discipline over court commissioners and referees.\n\nBackground\n\nCourt commissioners and referees (generally referred to as \"subordinate judicial officers\") handle certain matters that come before the local courts. Typically, commissioners and referees handle less complex cases such as traffic matters, family and juvenile matters, and small claims cases. Also, they can serve as temporary judges and hear more complex matters when the parties agree. There are about 370 commissioners and referees throughout the state. The presiding judge of each court is responsible for handling complaints and disciplinary matters against commissioners and referees. In contrast, the California Commission on Judicial Performance-an 11-member body appointed by the Supreme Court, the Governor, and the Legislature\u2014handles complaints and disciplinary matters against judges. \n\nProposal\n\nThis proposition would give the Commission on Judicial Performance, at its discretion, authority to oversee and discipline court commissioners or referees, just as it currently does for judges. The measure provides that a person who is found unfit to be a commissioner or referee by the Commission on Judicial Performance may not serve as a commissioner or referee. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nTo the extent that the Commission on Judicial Performance chooses to provide oversight and exercise discipline over court commissioners and referees, the state would incur additional costs. Any additional costs would probably be minor. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 221 \n\nOUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM CRIES OUT FOR REFORM. YET, FEW KNOW APPOINTED COURT COMMISSIONERS COULD ARBITRARILY DENY A PARENT THE RIGHT TO VISIT WITH HIS OR HER OWN CHILD. Unfortunately, newspaper reports of this kind of tragedy are all too common. In one case, a court commissioner awarded custody to a father who was on probation for exhibiting himself in front of children. In another, a court commissioner gave custody of children to a parent with history of drug abuse, fraud, forgery, and violence. Horror stories like this happen because our legal system lacks procedures to make appointed court commissioners accountable. Why? Court Commissioners are lawyers, with friends, enemies and business interests in the community. While most judges are elected, subject to recall and reviewed by the Commission on Judicial Performance, appointed court commissioners are overseen only by the single judge who appointed them. This measure grants the Commission on Judicial Performance the authority to review complaints that appointed commissioners are biased, unqualified, prejudiced or incapable of rendering good legal decisions because of conflicts of interest. The measure authorizes the Commission to discipline appointed commissioners who put law abiding Californians at risk by consistently making poor decisions. Holding court commissioners accountable for bad decisions is one step towards making our judiciary fairer and more accountable to the public. The Family Guardian Network, the Judicial Council, and Los Angeles County Superior Court Juvenile Division testified in support of these reforms. Please join them in backing our efforts to remedy this injustice. VOTE YES ON PROPOSITION 221.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: AMENDS CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION TO PERMIT 17-YEAR- OLDS TO VOTE IN PRIMARY AND SPECIAL ELECTIONS IF THEY WILL TURN 18 BY THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION AND BE OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT \n\nARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 18 \n\nProposition 18 will allow those who will be 18 years of age by the time of the general election to participate in the primary election of that year if they are 17 at the time of the primary. This important election reform will not only allow first-time voters to participate in the full election cycle, but also has the potential to boost youth participation in our elections. We need youth voices to be represented at the ballot box. Allowing some 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections if, and only if, they will be 18 by the time of the general election is a simple way to amplify the voices of young voters throughout California and will lead to a more inclusive election process for our state overall. California is behind the curve when it comes to this issue. Nearly half of states in the U.S. already allow 17-year-olds to participate in primaries and caucuses. If an individual plans to participate in the general election as a first-time voter, it is only reasonable that they be afforded the opportunity to shape the choices that appear on the general election ballot by participating in the primary. Proposition 18 links this 17-year-old participation to the age of majority by requiring that the individual be 18 by the time of the general election. According to research conducted by the California Civic Engagement Project, in the 2020 primary election in California, youth voters (those aged between 18 and 24) made up 14.5% of the population eligible to vote, however only about 6% of those who actually voted in the election. Youth are extremely underrepresented in our electoral process despite the fact that they are heavily impacted by the policies created by those elected. Not only does research indicate that the youth population has the lowest turnout levels out of any age demographic, but studies also show that voting is habit-forming-once an individual votes in an election, they are more likely to do so again. Early involvement in the electoral process for first-time voters should be a high priority for this reason. Proposition 18 is an opportunity to empower California's youngest voters and encourage them to become life-long participants in the most fundamental act of democracy. Please support Proposition 18. KEVIN MULLIN, Assemblymember CA Assembly District 22 EVAN LOW, Assemblymember CA Assembly District 28 \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 18\n\nThe statement that \u201cnearly half\" of the states allow 17-year-olds to vote in the primary is dishonest. ONLY 18 ALLOW IT, and their primaries are different from California's. Because of Propositions 13 and 218, Californians have the right to vote on tax proposals, which are often on the primary ballot. 17-year-olds have virtually no experience with earning a living and paying taxes. Real life experience is vital for voting. The suggestion that it is \u201conly logical\u201d that 17-year-olds should vote in the Primary if they are going to vote in the General is bad reasoning. Since California's primary has been moved to early March, Proposition 18 would give high-school minors JUST BARELY 17 the right to vote simply because they will turn 18 EIGHT MONTHS LATER. 17-year-olds are minors, for several reasons: \u2022 Science affirms that the reasoning and logic portion of their brains is NOT BIOLOGICALLY FULLY DEVELOPED. \u2022 They are a captive audience (5+ hours per day, 5 days per week) to teachers on whom they depend for present and future success, making them very VULNERABLE TO ONE-SIDED INFLUENCE. \u2022 They have NO REAL-WORLD EXPERIENCE. Most have not had to work to support themselves, nor make their own way to pay for taxes, rent, food, etc. They have no frame of reference to make the vital decisions voters make for themselves and all other members of society when they vote. 17-year-olds may be eager to vote, but they are not yet ready. VOTE NO on PROPOSITION 18. RUTH WEISS, Vice President Election Integrity Project of California JON COUPAL, President Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association LARRY SAND, Retired Teacher \n\nARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 18\n\nVote No on Proposition 18 \"Many tax increases and bond debt measures are decided on primary and special election ballots. That's why only adults should vote.\"-Jon Coupal, President, Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association 17-YEAR-OLDS ARE NOT LEGALLY ADULTS Both the federal and California governments have set the age of legal responsibility at 18. In California, an individual even one day younger than 18 may not enter into a legal contract, or even use a tanning salon. Seventeen-year-olds cannot even participate in a school field trip without a permission slip signed by a parent or guardian. California law puts extra rules and restrictions on driver licenses of 16- and 17-year-olds because of concerns about maturity and judgment. The license restrictions disappear exactly on the 18th birthday, not before. California law reflects the scientific evidence that age- related brain development is connected to the ability to reason, analyze and comprehend cause-and-effect. The agreed-upon age of reason, both statewide and nationally, is 18. 17-YEAR-OLDS ARE CAPTIVE AUDIENCES IN SCHOOL Voters deserve to hear all sides of an issue to make an informed choice. Most 17-year-olds are still in high school, dependent on teachers for grades and important recommendation letters vital to their future. They are a captive audience five days a week, with a strong incentive to do whatever teachers and counselors recommend. California's primary ballot often includes school tax and bond measures for voter approval. Unlike adult voters, 17-year-olds who are still in high school are likely to hear only one side of these issues. For example, in 2019, the Los Angeles Unified School District engaged in an \u201cinformational\" campaign to pass a proposed tax increase, Measure EE, in a special election. Schools posted huge banners on campus, handed out flyers and literature for students to take home, and even distributed sample social media posts in an effort to influence students and their families. If 17-year-olds are allowed to vote in primary and special elections, perhaps even filling out a mail-in ballot right in the classroom, these students could provide the margin to approve new debt and taxes that will greatly burden their parents and all taxpayers. POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IS OPEN TO ALL; VOTING IS DIFFERENT Everyone has the right to express an opinion, advocate on issues, organize like-minded people and volunteer on campaigns. The right to vote, however, is reserved for citizens who are state residents, who are not felons in prison, and who are at least 18 years of age on Election Day. Voting is a serious responsibility. In California elections, voters decide who will hold the power to make and enforce laws, whether to approve new debt that taxpayers will have to pay, whether to raise taxes, and many other complex issues. Important decisions must be made by voters who are legally adults, not by high school minors. VOTE NO on Proposition 18. RUTH WEISS, Co-founder Election Integrity Project California JON COUPAL, President Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association LARRY SAND, Retired Teacher \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 18\n\n17-year-olds already work and pay taxes, and they can enlist in the military. If young people at this age are volunteering to put their lives on the line for our country and contributing financially to society, they should be able to participate in a full election cycle the year they turn 18. Prop. 18 allows 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections if they are 18 by the general election. Figuring out how to vote, where to vote, and what is on the ballot is a difficult first-time process. Giving young people time to learn this the year they turn 18 ensures a successful first voting experience. Expanding young people's opportunity to become civically engaged ensures that our future generations will adopt voting habits early on and take them as they go to college, join the military, or join the workforce. In the March 2020 primary, which saw the most votes in a California presidential primary ever, only 38% of eligible voters cast a ballot. We have a civic engagement problem, and we need to establish a culture of voting for future generations sooner rather than later. Voting in one election can increase the probability of voting in the next election by over 25%. Issues like the climate crisis, student debt, healthcare, and our economic future will impact young people the most, and it is our responsibility to provide them adequate opportunities to create lifelong voting habits. A vote for Prop. 18 is a vote for our democracy. MARY CREASMAN, Chief Executive Officer California League of Conservation Voters (CLCV) SENATOR RICHARD D.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: PERMITS LEGISLATURE TO EXCLUDE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED RAIN-CAPTURE SYSTEMS FROM PROPERTY-TAX REASSESSMENT REQUIREMENT. LEGISLATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. \n\nOFFICIAL TITLE AND SUMMARY\n\n\u2022 Except in certain circumstances, under the California Constitution, construction on existing property requires reassessment for tax purposes. \u2022 The California Constitution permits the Legislature to exempt some construction on existing property from property-tax reassessment requirements. \u2022 Amends the California Constitution to permit the Legislature to exempt the construction or addition of rain-capture systems from the type of construction that would require a property-tax reassessment. Applicable to construction or addition of rain-capture systems completed on or after January 1, 2019. SUMMARY OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S ESTIMATE OF NET STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FISCAL IMPACT: \u2022 Probably minor reduction in annual property tax revenues to local governments.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nCalifornia's Water Supplies Can Be Limited in Some Years. California has an extensive water system to deliver water from the northern part of the state where it is more plentiful-to farms and cities in other parts of the state. Water typically is delivered to houses and other buildings through local public water systems. The amount of water available through these water systems can vary widely from year to year. In years with less rain and snow, it can be difficult to provide enough water for all of the state's farms, residents, and businesses. In response, the state and local governments have looked for other ways to provide water to those who want it. \n\nRainwater Capture Systems Collect Water for Use on Site. Rainwater capture systems are one way to create additional supplies of water. A rainwater capture system collects and stores rainwater that falls on the roof of a building. The system uses pipes to direct water from roofs and gutters to large storage tanks. Stored water can be used for things like watering plants or flushing toilets. As a result, these systems reduce somewhat the demand for water from local water systems. Rainwater capture systems installed on homes typically cost a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Systems installed on business properties or apartments typically cost several thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. \n\nLocal Governments Levy Taxes on Property Owners. California local governments\u2014cities, counties, schools, and special districts-levy property taxes on property owners based on the value of their property. A property includes land plus any buildings or other improvements on the land. Property taxes are a major revenue source for local governments, raising over $60 billion per year statewide. \n\nCalculating a Property Owner's Tax Bill. Each property owner's annual property tax bill is equal to the taxable value of their property multiplied by their property tax rate. The typical property owner's property tax rate is 1.1 percent. In the year a property is purchased, its taxable value is its purchase price. Each year after that the property's taxable value is adjusted for inflation (up to 2 percent). This continues until the property is sold and again is taxed at its purchase price. \n\nProperty Improvements Trigger a Higher Tax Bill. When a property owner makes an improvement to his or her property, the county assessor typically updates the property's taxable value to reflect the improvement. The county assessor first determines the value of the improvement. The improvement's value is based on the cost of building the improvement and how much it increases the price the property could be sold for. The county assessor then adds the value of the improvement to the property's prior taxable value to determine the property's new taxable value. \n\nCertain Improvements Do Not Increase Tax Payments. Past measures approved by buildings or who purchase new buildings that voters require that county assessors not include these systems. Lower property tax count the value of certain types of property payments would mean lower revenues for local improvements toward a property's taxable governments. Statewide, these property tax value. Such improvements include solar revenue losses probably would be minor, not panels, fire sprinklers, and certain upgrades for earthquake safety. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nRainwater Capture Systems Not Counted Toward Taxable Value. This measure, which amends the State Constitution, allows the Legislature to exclude the value of a newly constructed rainwater capture system from a property's taxable value. Earlier this year, the Legislature passed a law to carry out this measure should it be approved by voters. Under this law, any systems installed between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2028 would not raise property tax bills. These property tax savings would apply until the property is sold. If a developer installs a system on a new building, the first buyer of the building may claim the property tax savings for the system. An Example. Here is an example of the property tax savings provided by this measure. Suppose a home has a taxable value of $400,000 and the homeowner's annual tax bill is $4,400 ($400,000 multiplied by 1.1 percent). The homeowner pays $5,000 to have a rainwater capture system installed. Without this measure, the county assessor would increase the home's taxable value to $405,000. The homeowner's annual tax bill would increase to $4,455 ($405,000 multiplied by 1.1 percent). With the measure, the home's taxable value and tax bill would not change. The homeowner's annual tax bill would still be $4,400, $55 lower than if the measure were not in place. \n\nFISCAL EFFECTS\n\nLikely Minor Reduction in Property Tax Revenues. This measure would result in lower property tax payments for property owners who install rainwater capture systems on existing exceeding a few million dollars per year. This is because properties with new rainwater capture systems probably will pay a very small share of all property tax payments in coming years. \n\nARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 72\n\nYes on Proposition 72 will prevent a property tax increase on homeowners who install rainwater recycling systems that benefit our entire state. That is urgent because California has experienced periods of drought and will likely face more dry years in the future. More Water, Less Taxes. Eliminating the tax penalty for Californians who install systems to store and reuse water off our roofs will preserve more water for all of us and can lower water bills for millions of Californians. It preserves precious drinking water for California residents and enables us to draw less water from our lakes, rivers and streams, helping fish and wildlife that depend on fresh water for their habitat and food. Supported by Outdoor and Environmental Groups. Yes on Proposition 72 is supported by environmental groups thoughout California, including Save The Bay, Planning and Conservation League and Trout Unlimited. Water conservation and environmentally sensitive water storage are important elements of our anti-drought response. Under current law, taxes increase when property owners make home improvements- even when such improvements have statewide benefit. Proposition 72 would allow people to install rainwater capture systems without triggering higher taxes. Australia has experienced severe drought and has embraced rainwater recycling systems as part of their solution. Currently, one-third of the Australian homes capture rainwater from their roofs. California voters approved a similar tax reform for solar systems. Because homeowners are not required to pay higher taxes when they install rooftop solar, our electricity costs are lower. A Yes vote on Proposition 72 would allow us to follow this exact same path. Stop The Unfair Tax on Water Conservation! It is unfair and unwise to raise taxes on Californians who capture rainwater from their roofs in order to conserve our drinking water. That is why the California State Senate and State Assembly, on unanimous bi-partisan votes, agreed to place this measure on the ballot. Storing and reusing rainwater benefits all of us. People should not have to pay a tax penalty for conserving water. Please vote Yes on Proposition 72.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: ESTABLISHES STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR KIDNEY DIALYSIS CLINICS. REQUIRES ON-SITE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. INITIATIVE STATUTE \n\nARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 23 \n\nLife-Saving Changes for Dialysis Patients Three times each and every week, 80,000 Californians with End Stage Renal Disease go to one of more than 600 commercial dialysis centers in the state where they spend three to four hours connected to a machine that removes their blood, cleans it, and returns it to their bodies. Dialysis literally is what keeps them alive, and they must continue the treatment for the rest of their lives or until they receive a kidney transplant. Because the lives of these fellow Californians are so dependent on dialysis that is done both safely and effectively, we give our absolute support to the Protect the Lives of Dialysis Patients Act, an initiative appearing on the Nov. 3 ballot. This initiative will make common-sense improvements to dialysis treatment that will protect some of the most medically vulnerable people in our society. The initiative does four major things: First, it requires a physician or nurse practitioner to be in the clinic any time patients are being treated, which is not currently required. Dialysis is a dangerous procedure, and if something goes wrong, a doctor or highly trained nurse should be nearby. Second, dialysis patients are prone to infections from their treatments that can lead to more serious illnesses or even death. This initiative requires clinics to report accurate data on infections to the state and federal governments so problems can be identified and solved to protect patients. Third, like all other life-saving health care facilities, the initiative says the dialysis corporations cannot close clinics or reduce their services unless approved by the state. This also is designed to protect patients, particularly in rural communities, to make sure they have access to dialysis treatment, and to stop the dialysis corporations from using closures to pad their bottom line. Fourth, it prohibits clinics from discriminating against patients because the type of insurance they have, and it protects patients in every clinic. No matter if they are located in a wealthy neighborhood or a poor, rural, Black or Brown community, all clinics will be required to have a doctor or nurse practitioner on site, all clinics will be required to report their infection rates to the state and federal governments, and all dialysis corporations will be prohibited from discriminating against patients because of the type of insurance they have. Don't listen when the dialysis industry claims the initiative will create huge new costs or say patients will be harmed or claim that it will create a shortage of doctors-those fake arguments are just designed to use patients and the coronavirus pandemic as scare tactics in their dishonest public relations campaign. The fact is, these corporations can easily make these changes and still make hundreds of millions of dollars a year without disrupting our healthcare system. Proposition 23 will make the changes we need to truly protect dialysis patients. We urge you to vote YES! MEGALLAN HANDFORD, Dialysis Registered Nurse PASTOR WILLIAM D. SMART, JR. Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Southern California CARMEN CARTAGENA, Dialysis Patient \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 23\n\nProposition 23 is a DANGEROUS, COSTLY MEASURE funded by one special interest group with no expertise in dialysis.

BRETAN, MD, President California Medical Association \n\nARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 23 \u2605 \n\nNURSES, DOCTORS AND PATIENTS URGE NO ON 23-THE DANGEROUS AND COSTLY DIALYSIS PROPOSITION Nearly 80,000 Californians with failed kidneys receive dialysis treatment three days a week to stay alive. Dialysis treatment does the job of the kidneys by removing toxins from the body. Missing a single treatment increases patient risk of death by 30%. Prop. 23 seriously jeopardizes access to care for tens of thousands of Californians who need dialysis to stay alive. That's why the American Nurses Association California, California Medical Association and patient advocates OPPOSE Prop. 23. PROP. 23 WOULD FORCE COMMUNITY DIALYSIS CLINICS TO CUT SERVICES AND CLOSE-PUTTING LIVES AT RISK Proposition 23 would force dialysis clinics to have a physician administrator on-site at all times, even though they would not care for patients. Each dialysis patient is already under the care of their personal kidney physician and dialysis treatments are administered by specially trained and experienced dialysis nurses and technicians. This useless bureaucratic mandate would increase clinic costs by hundreds of millions annually, putting half of all clinics at risk of closure. \"Prop. 23 dangerously reduces access to care, putting vulnerable dialysis patients at serious risk.\" -Marketa Houskova, Doctor of Nursing Practice, RN, American Nurses Association California PROP. 23 WOULD MAKE OUR PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE WORSE AND LEAD TO MORE EMERGENCY ROOM OVERCROWDING \"Proposition 23 would take thousands of doctors away from hospitals and clinics-where they're needed and place them into bureaucratic jobs at dialysis clinics where they aren't. This is not the time to make our physician shortage worse.' -Dr. Peter N. Bretan, MD, President, California Medical Association Emergency room doctors strongly oppose Prop. 23. It would force dialysis clinics to close-sending tens of thousands of vulnerable patients to emergency rooms, creating longer ER waits and reducing capacity to deal with serious emergencies. PROP. 23 WOULD INCREASE HEALTH CARE COSTS BY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS According to a study by the Berkeley Research Group, Prop. 23 would increase health care costs by $320 million annually. This massive increase would be especially damaging when so many Californians struggle financially. DIALYSIS CLINICS ARE STRICTLY REGULATED AND PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE The federal and state governments extensively regulate dialysis clinics. According to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, California dialysis clinics outperform other states in clinical quality and patient satisfaction. \"Every dialysis patient is under the care of a physician kidney specialist, and dialysis treatments are administered by specially-trained nurses and technicians. It makes no sense to require physician administrators on-site full-time.\" -Dr. Jeffrey Perlmutter, MD, President, Renal Physicians Association, representing 3,500 kidney doctors ANOTHER SPECIAL INTEREST ABUSE OF OUR INITIATIVE SYSTEM The same group promoting Prop. 23 spent $20,000,000 last election pushing a similar measure voters rejected.

BRETAN, MD, President California Medical Association \n\nREBUTTAL TO ARGUMENT AGAINST PROPOSITION 23\n\nDIALYSIS CORPORATIONS WANT TO PROTECT THEIR PROFITS In 2018, the California dialysis industry spent a record $110 million to defeat an initiative to improve conditions in dialysis clinics and protect patients from inflated billing. Why did they spend so much? To protect their massive $468 million in profits in California in 2018. To patients, dialysis is lifesaving. But to industry executives, it's a huge money-maker, so they're at it again, stoking fear by threatening to close clinics if Prop. 23 passes and they're held accountable to higher standards. Once again they are using gravely ill dialysis patients to shield their perks and million- dollar salaries. They claim, falsely, that the initiative will cost them huge sums of money, based on a highly dubious \"study\" that THEY paid for. ESTABLISHES STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR KIDNEY DIALYSIS PROPOSITION CLINICS. REQUIRES ON-SITE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. 23 INITIATIVE STATUTE. They claim doctors are against it, but many of those doctors are on their payroll. They say it will cause doctor shortages and overcrowded emergency rooms, but kidney doctors do not staff ERs. They say dialysis clinics are already highly regulated, but they face far fewer inspections than other health facilities, and even so deficiencies are often uncovered. EMANUEL GONZALES, Dialysis Technician PASTOR WILLIAM D. SMART, JR. Prop. 23 makes commonsense improvements to protect patients' lives, like having a doctor onsite to deal with emergencies, requiring the centers to report infection data, ending discrimination against some patients based on the type insurance they have, and requiring the state to approve any clinic closures so patients aren't left without treatment.

{"proposal_text": "PROPOSAL: \"None of the Above\" Ballot Option. \n\nOfficial Title and Summary\n\n\u2022 Provides that in general, special, primary and recall elections for President, Vice President, United States House of Representatives and Senate, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Controller, Secretary of State, Treasurer, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Insurance Commissioner, Board of Equalization, State Assembly and State Senate, voters may vote for \"none of the above\" rather than a named candidate. \u2022 Votes for \"none of the above\" shall be tallied and listed in official election results, but will not count for purposes of determining who wins election. Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact: Generally minor costs to state and county governments. \n\nBackground\n\nUnder current law, California voters who cast an election ballot for federal, state, or local offices select from a list of candidates seeking that elective position. In addition, voters may cast a write-in vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot. However, voters do not have the option of casting a ballot for \"none of the above\" instead of choosing a candidate. \n\nProposal\n\nThis measure would require that all election ballots for federal and state offices shown in Figure 1 provide voters with the option of voting for \"none of the above.\" A voter could cast a ballot for \"none of the above\" in a general, special, primary, or recall election for those offices. Elections for judges and local offices would not include the option of voting for \"none of the above.\" Under this measure, only votes cast for candidates whose names appear on the ballot or for write-in candidates would be counted when determining the nomination or election of candidates for those state and federal offices. The number of voters selecting \"none of the above\" would be reported in official election returns but would not affect the outcome of the election. \n\nFiscal Effect \n\nThis measure would generally result in minor costs for the state and for county governments to modify their vote-counting and election-reporting procedures as a result of adding the choice of \u201cnone of the above\" to candidate election ballots. \n\nArgument in Favor of Proposition 23 \n\nWe are three California citizens who usually don't vote. At times, we've wanted to protest the choices given to us, express our discontent over negative campaigning or object to the lack of relevant information about the candidates. Until now, the only way we could be heard was to simply not vote. Unfortunately, not voting doesn't get you heard, it just gets you labeled as apathetic. If we had the option of voting for \"none of the above,\" we would have the opportunity to have our protest counted and our voices heard. More people like us would vote if they had a choice-to vote for a worthy candidate, or to vote for \"none of the above\" in an election where none of the candidates was worthy. If Proposition 23 passes, the candidate with the most votes would still get the job. But, each vote would be meaningful not just a decision between the \"lesser of two evils.\" If candidates knew that Californians could vote for \"none of the above,\" they might be more likely to run campaigns based on issues and positive messages rather than campaigns that simply attack opponents. And, you'd find more of us at the polls, voting on all the issues and candidates. We believe that having the option to vote for \"none of the above\" will accomplish several things: More citizens will register to vote. \u2022 More registered voters will vote. \u2022 Better candidates will be nominated. Negative campaigning will be reduced. The ability to vote for \"none of the above\" is only one method of getting wider participation in the election process, and the cost to do so is negligible. Voter reform doesn't have to be complicated. We urge a YES vote for Proposition 23. \u2022 AMANDA GUTWIRTH Social Worker DAVID JAMES Small Business Owner SUSAN HOWELL Waitress\n\nRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 23 \n\nThe proponents of this initiative hope that it will boost voter registration, increase voter turnout, improve the quality of candidates and reduce negative campaigning. These are commendable goals, and we support them all. Unfortunately, in the one state (Nevada) where NOTA is used, it hasn't achieved any of them. The reason is simple: voters quickly realize that casting a vote for NOTA is a waste, so after a brief flurry of interest in NOTA, voters stop using the option, and candidates continue behaving as before. NOTA isn't the answer, but the problems this initiative attempts to address are real and serious: inadequate choice at the ballot booth, poor treatment of the issues and negative campaigning. What can be done? We can promote reforms that give all voters a meaningful way to vote FOR their favorite candidate, which would encourage candidates to campaign on the issues. Such reforms aren't pipe dreams: voters in Santa Clara County have already passed an initiative to allow the Instant Runoff, and because it saves money and reduces negative campaigning, several California cities are considering it. Most established democracies in the world use proportional representation combined with public financing of elections. Proportional representation creates true multi-choice democracy where more people win representation in the legislature. It also fosters positive debate of issues and produces policies that are more representative of the majority's will. Vote No on NOTA, and work for reforms that allow you to cast a vote that counts FOR your favorite candidate. JOHN B. ANDERSON 1980 Independent Presidential Candidate JULIE PARTANSKY Mayor of Davis\n\nArgument Against Proposition 23 \n\nEver feel like your vote didn't count very much? This initiative would just make things worse. It would give you the option of voting for None-of-the-Above (NOTA), but it's non-binding. What's the point? Even if it were binding, NOT\u0102 is a poor substitute for true democracy. If you want to throw your vote away, DON'T VOTE. But if you do vote, you should be able to cast a meaningful vote for a candidate you like. Polls show that most Californians are unhappy with the two major parties, and most Californians would like to see a credible third party. Unfortunately, this initiative would just draw votes away from candidates who are trying to provide credible alternatives to the major parties. History has shown that new ideas and policy innovations like the abolition of slavery and women's right to vote-often derive from third parties, so discouraging those candidates is a disservice to voters. With our current winner-take-all voting system, if you are dissatisfied with the two major candidates, you are in a bind. You either settle for the \"lesser of two evils,\" or you cast a protest vote for the candidate you prefer, knowing your candidate has little chance of winning. NOTA just gives you an even worse option: voting for something that can't win, even if it gets the most votes. Fortunately, there are a couple of PROVEN SOLUTIONS to this very real problem with our voting system. The first is called the Instant Runoff, and it allows you to rank a first choice, a second choice and a third choice. It solves the \"spoiler\u201d problem, because if your first choice candidate is defeated, your vote counts for your second choice. It also saves the cost of runoff elections, because it produces a majority winner in a single election. As an added bonus, the Instant Runoff promotes coalition building and positive, issue-oriented campaigning. Because the Instant Runoff saves tax dollars and gives voters more choice, legislation for the Instant Runoff is pending in several California cities, and has been introduced at the state level in Alaska, New Mexico and Vermont. The second is called Proportional Representation, which is the common sense notion that all Californians deserve representation, not just the biggest group in a like applying the town or election district. Proportional representation is free market to the political marketplace: it would give voters the multiplicity of choices that we demand as consumers. It's also a form of campaign finance reform. Candidates need a lower percentage of votes to win, so they can concentrate on promoting their issues and policies to their likely supporters instead of promising everything to everybody and standing for nothing. To learn more about these reforms, visit the website of the non-partisan Center for Voting and Democracy: www.fairvote.org. Unlike NOTA, these reforms will give voters real choices and more power. Vote NO on 23, and join the Green Party in working for real reforms that give all Californians a meaningful vote. SARA AMIR Spokesperson, Green Party of California 23 JOHN STRAWN Spokesperson, Green Party of California DONA SPRING City Councilmember, Berkeley\n\nRebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 23 \n\nThe point of Proposition 23 is that it offers a real option to California voters. The opportunity to vote for \"None of the Above\" gives a voter a choice if he or she does not want to vote for any of the candidates that are on the ballot for a particular office. Proposition 23 provides an alternative for voters that will be counted and recorded if none of the candidates are deemed worthy. It makes no sense to argue against Proposition 23 by trying to confuse voters by talking about alternatives that are not even on the ballot. Proposition 23 is clear and simple don't make it complicated. Vote \"Yes\" on Proposition 23. ALAN F. SHUGART Businessman", "proposal_id": "cfacba6b-1bcb-486c-bbda-a449a6fb4402.txt"}

However, the interface and its underlying role in carrier transport\/recombination kinetics for such perovskite devices prepared under ambient air is still obscure. Herein, we addressed this issue by a dynamic intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) model using a continuity equation. The interface and its role in charge-carrier transport\/recombination kinetics have been explored and discussed as an approach to understand the origin of the photovoltaic properties for the devices prepared under ambient air. The experimental IMVS responses were measured and satisfactorily fitted to the analytical results. Compared to the typical IMVS model based on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), the better IMVS fitting results presented in this study indicated that there was a discrepancy between the planar perovskite devices and those of DSSCs in electron transport\/recombination properties, because carrier transfer across the TiO2\/liquid electrolyte interface in DSSCs has been modified. That is, the Schottky interface in DSSCs needs to be replaced by the semiconductor heterojunction interface in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Besides, the interface exhibits a more significant role in determining the carrier transport\/recombination process by influencing the boundary conditions in a continuity equation. Furthermore, the intensity modulated photocurrent\/photovoltage spectroscopy responses demonstrated that the carrier recombination characteristic is ultimately related with the surface and defect density in the interface. Interfacial modification, such as air-annealing, resulting in crystallographic changes, oxygen passivation, and variation in grain domain size, could suppress carrier recombination and prolong charge lifetime, which can yield more photo-generated electrons to be collected by anode, subsequently resulting in strikingly improving photovoltaic performance of the devices. In short, the dynamic IMVS model would help in elucidating the role of interface and the importance of interfacial modification or even interface design in order to obtain a highly efficient solar cell. The study can not only pave the way to construct the current\u2212voltage curve using a continuity equation model, but also provide new insights into the performance-improving steps for the PSCs prepared under fully open air conditions, which is of great importance for their future commercialization."}],"ideal":"The interface and its role in carrier transfer\/recombination dynamics for the planar perovskite solar cells prepared under fully open air conditions"}

The formation of a compact and uniform perovskite layer with large crystal size is a significant factor to get the best device performance. In this work, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) was used as a ferroelectric polymer additive to fabricate high-performance mesoporous CH3NH3PbI3-xClx mixed-halide perovskite solar cells in a sequential deposition method. Power conversion efficiency has been enhanced from 10.4 to 16.51% in an ambient atmosphere in the presence of an optimized amount of PVDF assuring continuous and smooth layers with large grain size. Besides morphological improvements, this progress in the photovoltaic performance is attributed to the dipole field exerted by PVDF that leads to enhanced charge separation. Further improvements in efficiency (18.60%) have been achieved by directing the dipoles under an external field."}],"ideal":"Enhanced electron transport induced by a ferroelectric field in efficient halide perovskite solar cells"}

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that the crystal size of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) increased after solvent treatment to PEDOT: PSS. MAPbI3 film with a uniform crystal size and smooth surface was obtained when being deposited on top of PEDOT: PSS that has been modified with solvent with a strong coordination ability. In the other cases, crystal size homogeneity and surface roughness of the MAPbI3 film was worse. The improved surface roughness and crystal size homogeneity of the MAPbI3 film enhanced the short circuit current (JSC), and therefore the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSC. It was found that both the stability of the intermediate phase MAI-DMSO-PbI2, which is related to the coordination ability of the solvent molecules, and the morphology of PEDOT: PSS film, influenced the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) film.

The semitransparent perovskite film (average visible transmittance, AVT of \u02dc 35.2%) is prepared from PbICl layer assisting sequential inter-diffusion process in which PMMA (PMMA dissolved in chlorobenzene) is added into CH3NH3I (MAI) solution. The presence of PMMA in perovskite films have a negligible effect on transparency, and the coverage and crystallinity of perovskite films are improved. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) characterization further demonstrate that the PMMA embedded perovskite films have better carrier transport and enhanced carrier extraction rate.

The pulse-by-pulse nature of the thin-film deposition method pulsed laser deposition (PLD) provides an opportunity to form material alloys where the chemical composition is controlled at the nanometer scale. These digital alloys may prove to be a powerful materials class to meet some of the multifunctional needs of thin film devices.

Humidity and annealing temperature have great effect on the morphology of perovskite layer in one step method. It was found that in one step method by increasing the humidity from <10% to ~40% (during spin coating and annealing the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite) morphology of the spin coated layer evolves from mostly ribbon shape with a large number of voids to layers comprising hollow fibers. However increase of the annealing temperature from 100 to 140\u202f\u00b0C results in decreasing the diameter of the formed hollow fibers. In hot casting technique, by controlling the casting temperature, a very compact flat layer including lotus leaf-like morph with fewer pinholes can be created.

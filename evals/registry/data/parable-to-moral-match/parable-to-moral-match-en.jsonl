The axe was all he possessed with which to make a living, and he had not money enough to buy a new one.

It was only natural for them to be angry. The troll family had lived a great adventure to find that magic book. It was their only hope of stopping scaring everyone with their horrible looks. A book of magic is very delicate and papa troll was such a brute …the book was ruined so they all had to accept the way they looked and carry on with their lives. As they didn't have any other books, little trollita decided to keep it and make some of the recipes. \"Ugh! we don't like this food. from now on you will eat whatever you make from that book by yourself.\" Shouted mama and papa troll. Some time later, a brave knight in shining armour passed by. He saw trollita with her parents and shouted, \"Fear not, princess, for I will help you escape from these horrible trolls!\"However, it was the knight who could not escape from a good whack. He was still on the ground when trollita saw a reflection in his armour. Given that all the mirrors in her house had been broken for a long time, she felt a little curious. She moved closer to see her own reflection and couldn't believe her eyes: she looked like a normal girl! She looked again and again, it had to be her. How had she turned into this? The confusion did not last long and they soon discovered that none of them were trolls. They ate so little fruit and vegetables that they had been unable to see properly, and their cuts never healed fully, nor did anything… that's why they looked so bad! And, of course, as soon as trollita started eating the recipes from the healthy cookbook, she looked lovely! \"We would have preferred to use the magic to stop looking like trolls but eating your recipes won't be that difficult,\" Said trollita's parents. Needless to say, it did not prove difficult and they soon got used to the food and actually enjoyed it too. And when they had learnt all the recipes from the book, they went in search of a child that hated healthy food and gave it to them to stop them looking like a troll too.

Like many others, sir emile spent years studying the cruel and wicked behaviour of the dragons of his time. However, his own particular conclusions were unique and unusual: dragons lived in a constant state of anger, which created the fire that came from their mouths. So, when he decided to finish the dragons off, he swapped the normal weapons and armour of a knight for something rather unusual: a joke and a cart full of ice creams. When the first dragon came to eat him, sir emile shouted his joke at it. It was such a good joke that even the dragon had to laugh. Just as the brave knight had expected, this blew the dragon's fire out. Just as the dragon was laughing, sir emile offered it an ice cream…how refreshed and pleasant the dragon now felt, after years of having had a fiery throat! Taking advantage of the dragon having calmed down for a moment, sir emile offered it a piece of fruit, and to the dragon this tasted heavenly. Dragons didn't normally eat fruit or vegetables, because the fire of their mouths burned such food and left it without any taste. So they preferred to eat cows or people, which, even though left a bit singed, at least tasted of something. However, when the dragon tasted fresh fruit for the first time, it felt so happy and joyful that even its terrible appearance began to change. It had looked so bad because of its awful diet, but after only a few days of this new, healthier, life, the dragon disappeared one night. All that remained of it was a beautiful butterfly with large colourful wings…and so it was, that sir emile, using only some good jokes and a cart full of ice cream and fruit, made the last thousand dragons disappear and take up new life in the form of beautiful butterflies.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Maybe the best way to know what they're like is to know what their favourite food is. To your average moloko there's nothing more delicious than a huge planet, with its oceans, deserts and mountains. And from all of them, there's no one like the great tuton. As big as a star, he could swallow a medium-sized planet in one gulp. He was also great at finding the tastiest planets, and this had made him the most famous of the molokos. But even greater than his fame as an explorer was his fame for being so selfish, since he never shared even a morsel of his wonderful meals, so the other molokos only just managed to samples some crumbs left from the mountains. For thousands of years - because molokos live a very long time so that they can grow so big -  tuton dined on the best planets. But it so happened that one of those planets, a lovely one of red, blue and yellow, whose crust had the best flavour you could imagine, turned out to have a centre made of the hardest steel in the universe, and the previously indestructible teeth of our famous moloko shattered into a thousand pieces. Nothing like that had ever happened to a moloko, and it turned out to be the worst of eventualities. So many mouth-watering planets within his reach, and he didn't even have a single tooth to make an impression on them. And when he asked for help from the other molokos, they all remembered his old selfishness, and how he had never left them anything but the smallest crumbs of planets whose flavour was of much worse flavour than what tuton had been accustomed to. And the previously colossal and famous planet eater became a beggar, going through all kinds of suffering and calamity. All he knew was crying, asking, begging… and hunger. And he had to spend a long time living like that, until he realised that if he wanted to be given something he would have to be the first to give, even though he was as miserable and poor as he was. And thinking about the little he had to give, he realised that he was still a brilliant discoverer of the tastiest planets. So he talked with some other molokos, and he offered to show them where the best planets hid themselves. What great joy for everyone! They discovered flavours they didn't know even existed. And the molokos, grateful to tuton for sharing with them his great skill, became much more attentive to him, and never again did he lack someone to help crush up some mountains or make him a lovely desert juice.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Her parents explained to her, everyday and with great patience, that these things were not monsters. Marina understood her parents, but she could not stop feeling an awful fear whenever it was dark. One day her aunt valerie came to visit. Valerie was an incredible woman. She was famous for her courage, and for having gone on many journeys of adventure, some of which had been made into books and movies. Marina wanted to conquer her fear of the dark, so she asked her aunt how she became so brave, and whether she had ever been frightened. \"A great many times, marina,\" Answered her aunt, \"I remember when I was small and I was terribly afraid of the dark. I couldn't stay in the dark for even a moment\". Marina became very excited. How was it possible that someone so courageous could have been afraid of the dark? \"I'll tell you a secret, marina. it was some blind children who taught me how to be brave. they can't see, so if they had never discovered the secret of how not to be afraid of the dark, they would have been forever frightened\". \"It's true!\" Said marina, intrigued, \"Can you tell me that secret?\" \"Of course! the secret is to change your eyes. since blind children can't see, their hands are their eyes. all you have to do to conquer your fear is what they do. shut the eyes of your face and open the eyes of your hands. let's make a deal: tonight, when you go to bed and put out the light, if anything makes you afraid, close your eyes, carefully get out of bed, and try to see what it is that's making you scared. but do it using your hands as eyes… and tomorrow tell me how you're getting on with the fear\". Marina accepted, but she was rather worried. She knew she would need to be brave to close her eyes and go and touch whatever it was that was frightening her; but she was willing to try because she was already too old for this. When her parents took her to bed, she herself put out the light. After a little while, she felt afraid of one of the shadows in the bedroom. Following the advice of aunt valerie, she closed the eyes of her face and opened the eyes of her hands. And, summoning up all her courage, she went over to touch that mysterious shadow…the next morning marina came running into the kitchen, a big smile on her face, and a song on her lips. \"The monster is so soft and smooth!…\" She cried, \"It's my teddy bear!\"\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

That very night she stayed awake as long as she could. As soon as she heard the first snuffles of her father's snoring she grabbed a hammer and went straight to her parents' bedroom. She slowly tiptoed in, being careful not to make a sound. She didn't want the hair thief to hear her. When she arrived at her father's side she began watchfully inspecting his head, determined to catch the hair thief as soon as he appeared. Before long, she saw a shadow on her daddy's head and, with every last ounce of her strength, she swung the hammer down. Thwack! Her father let out an enormous yelp and in a single movement leapt out of bed. The lump on his head was already big, and growing. Trembling with shock, he turned the light on, and saw valerie brandishing her hammer in the air. \"I nearly got him, daddy! I thought I hit him, but it looks like he escaped!\" Meanwhile, all the commotion had woken valerie's mother up. Seeing the lump on her husband's head, she burst out laughing. \"Well, that's what happens when you tell silly stories,\" She said, highly amused. So valerie's father had to explain to her that the hair thief didn't exist, and that going bald is something that just happens naturally to most daddies. There he sat, with a huge lump on his head, realising just how important it is not to tell children tall tales. And valerie still worried about her daddy, but she no longer lay in wait for the hair thief.

Streams dried up, trees withered and the mountain became covered in grim grey rock. The moon, who was always bright and shining, wanted to help her friend. However, she was very kind but not very clever and the only thing that occurred to her was to make a hole in her lower part and blow through it softly. In this way, a small amount of the magic dust that made her shine would fall on the mountain in the form of light snow. Once opened, nobody could seal the hole again. The moon didn't mind, however. She continued to blow and after several nights lost all her white dust. Without it, the moon looked so empty that she was almost invisible and the nights became completely dark and sad. Upset by this, the mountain wanted to give the snow back to her friend. However, because it was impossible to make it snow upwards, she lit a fire inside herself until she became a volcano. The fire turned the snow into a dense white smoke that rose up as high as the moon, filling her gradually each night until she was once again full and bright. However, when the snow stopped, and with it the smoke, the hole in the moon remained open, and she had no choice but to share her magic again until she was hollow once more. The moon set off on her travels in the hope of finding another mountain who could turn into a volcano, and she came across a town that needed her help desperately. She was too weak to stop her kind heart so she blew on the town, filling it with happiness until she herself stopped shining. It seemed as if the moon would never shine again but, just like the mountain, the grateful town also found a way to make it snow upwards. So did the next one, and the next, and every one after that. And so, every month, the moon generously sprinkles her magic dust across the world until she disappears, knowing that in a few days her friends would find a way to make her shine brightly again.

They were no longer so foolish as to wage wars with terrible battles in which thousands died. Now, every year they held bowling matches instead. A giant against a dragon. Whoever lost would become the winner's slave. If a dragon won, he could use the giant's muscles for all that heavy lifting. If a giant won, he would have free flights and fire for the whole year. That is how they prevented their deaths and yet they hated each other more and more. Every year the winners were so cruel to the losers, in revenge for the times they had lost. There came a time when what mattered most was not winning the bowling match, but rather not losing. Yonk the giant was the best bowler, and the most afraid. He had never lost. Many dragons had been his slaves and they were dying to see him lose so they could get their revenge. This is why yonk was terrified of losing. Especially since last year's match, when he missed his first ever strike and decided that something had to change. The following year he won again. When he arrived home, his slave dragon feared the worst but yonk had a different idea in mind. \"This year you will not be my slave. we will go bowling and I will teach you all of my secrets. but you must promise me one thing: when you win your match next year, you will not be cruel to your giant. do the same as I am doing with you.\"The dragon gladly accepted. Yonk kept his promise and he spent the entire year without flying or warming himself with the dragon's fire breathing. The dragon also kept his promise and both did exactly the same every year afterwards. Yonk's idea became so popular that, within just a few years, many giants and dragons were spending their days bowling together. They forgot about their battles and cruelty and treated each other as play friends rather than enemies. Much later yonk lost his first bowling match but he was no longer afraid of losing because, by putting a stop to the enslavement of dragons, he had ended their hatred and sowed the seeds of an almost impossible peace between giants and dragons.

He looked at everything as though it were a beautiful painting, and, in the blink of an eye, he could paint anything at all, filling it with magic and colour. One day, brian and his grandfather went to spend a weekend at the palace of the marquis of castling. The marquis was an old friend of brian's grandfather; and was a very famous chess player. When they arrived, brian went into a large room and found a lovely chess set, totally hand carved, and with its own marble table which acted as the board. This chess set caught brian's artistic eye. However, he felt that these pieces were too uniform. Along with the blacks and whites of the board, it amounted to rather a bland set. So, that night, - paint box in hand - he tiptoed from his room to the chess room. There he spent the night painting each piece in the most colourful way. When the pieces were done, he painted a beautiful scene on the marble chessboard. Brian hoped to use his art to really surprise his grandfather and the marquis. However, the next morning, when the marquis discovered that his pieces had been covered in a thousand colours, instead of being pleased, he was very angry. That afternoon he had a very important match to play. However lovely all those colours were, it would be impossible to play chess without being able to know which pieces were which; and even more difficult now that the squares of the board were covered with a painting. Brian's grandfather explained to him that even the loveliest, most colourful things need some sense of order to them. The boy felt very hurt, remembering how many times his paintings had annoyed people…but brian bristles was a true artist, and he wasn't about to give up easily. A little while later he went to his grandfather and the marquis, and asked their permission to rectify what he had done to the chess set. Knowing how ingeniously artistic the boy was, they decided to give him a chance, so brian went off and spent hours alone with his paints. When he was finished, shortly before the match was about to begin, he called for the two men and showed them his work. What a beautiful chess set it now was! Now there were two perfectly recognisable teams; that of night and that of day. On one side, the board and the pieces had been decorated with dozens of stars and moons of all sizes and colours. On the other side the decorations were suns, clouds, and rainbows. It was done so well that the whole set had an unmatchable sense of order and harmony. Brian understood that a little order had been missing, but he had now managed to impose some without giving up any colour. The two grown-ups looked at the paintings and smiled. It was obvious that brian bristles would become a great artist.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

The frog, surprised, asked johnny:   -\"Why are you carrying such a horrible old tail when you already have such a lovely tail of your own?\" -\"Because I spent months looking for it,\" Replied johnny. -\"You really spent months looking for something so ugly and dirty?\" Said the frog. -\"Well,\"Johnny explained, -\"Previously it wasn't as ugly as this…\" -\"Hmm, but now it is, wouldn't you agree?… how strange you lizards are!\" Said the frog before jumping off into the distance. The frog was right. Johnny still thought of his tail as though it was the same tail he used to have, but in reality it was now disgusting. Now johnny understood, so he decided to drop his old tail there, leaving with it all his past worries. As he continued his journey all he took with him were thoughts of the future.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Three of those rich men, and their servants, were traveling on the same road, in a convoy, when they came to a very poor village. Seeing this poverty provoked different reactions in all three rich men. The first couldn't stand to see it, so he took all the gold and jewels from his wagons and shared them out among the villagers. He wished them all the best of luck, and he left. The second rich man, seeing the desperate situation, stopped for a short time, and gave the villagers all his food and drink, since he could see that money would be of little use to them. He made sure that each villager received their fair share and would have enough food to last for some time. Then, he left. The third rich man, on seeing such poverty, speeded up and traveled straight through the village without stopping. The two other rich men saw this from a distance, and commented with each other how the third rich man lacked decency and compassion. It was good that they had been there to help the poor villagers…however, three days later, they met the third rich man who was traveling in the opposite direction. He was still traveling quickly, but his wagons, instead of the gold and valuables they had been carrying, were now full of farming implements, tools, and sacks of seeds and grain. He was heading to the poor village to help them out of poverty. This happened a long, long time ago, but we can see the very same thing happening today too. There are some generous people who give only so that people can see how much they are giving. They don't want to know anything about the people they are giving to. Other generous people really try to help others, but only so that they can feel better about themselves. But there are other generous people: the best kind. To them it doesn't matter what the other kinds of generous people think of them. Nor do they give in a showy way. Instead, they truly worry about how best to improve the lives of those they are helping. They give greatly of something much more valuable than money.

It was as white as driven snow, its petals looked like velvet, and the morning dew shone from its leaves like resplendent crystals. The flower couldn't see herself, so she had no idea how pretty she was. And so it was that she spent the few days of her life, until wilting set on, without knowing that all around her were amazed by her and her perfection: her perfume, the softness of her petals, her elegance. She didn't realise that everyone who saw her spoke well of her. The weeds that surrounded her were fascinated by her beauty, and lived in a state of enchantment at her aroma and appearance. One hot, sunny day, a girl was strolling through the garden, thinking about how many lovely things mother nature has given us, when she suddenly saw a white rose in a forgotten part of the garden. The rose was beginning to fade and wilt. -\"It's days since it rained,\" She thought, -\"If the rose stays here till tomorrow it'll be totally withered. I'll take it home and put it in the lovely vase I got as a present.\"And so she did. With all her love she put the wilting white rose in water, inside a lovely colourful glass vase, and placed it by the window. -\"I'll put it here,\" She thought, -\"So the flower can get some sun.\"What the young girl didn't realise was that the reflection from the window meant that, for the first time, the rose got to see herself and what she looked like. -\"Is that me?\" Thought the rose. Little by little her drooping leaves began to rise, once again stretching up towards the sun, and, gradually, the rose recovered her former appearance. When she was totally back to her best she looked at her reflection and saw that she was indeed a beautiful flower. She thought    -\"Wow! till now I hadn't realised who I was, how could I have been so blind?\"The rose came to realise she had spent her days without appreciating her beauty, unable to see herself, unable to know who she really was.

It was time for the great acrobatic balloon competition. Every insect in the garden had been training hard, and now they were preparing to begin their routines. The balloon competitions were always something really special, since they could only happen after the children of the house had had some big party. There was only a short window of opportunity too, before the parents came round to collect up the balloons. Each time, the flying insects were favourites to win, because they could grab the balloon strings and fly off in all directions, creating all sorts of patterns in the air. However, on this occasion there were some rather unusual insects taking part: a group of ants. Of course, no one expected that they'd do anything special. They were so light that no ant had ever bothered to take part, but it was quite impressive to see all the ants all perfectly organised and prepared. So the competition began, and the different insects took their turns, performing beautiful manoeuvres with the balloons. As always, the butterfly and the firefly left everyone amazed with their twist and turns, and their wonderful colours. When it was time for the ants to perform, it seemed like the competition had already been decided. For the first time in living memory, the ants shared just one balloon between them, and one by one they climbed up the balloon string; forming a thin black thread of ants. When all the string was covered, the last ant climbed over his teammates to reach the balloon. Once there, he climbed onto the top of the balloon. This strange spectacle attracted everyone's curiosity, and they were just about to witness the most important moment: the ant opened his jaws as wide as he could… and then he stabbed the balloon with all his might! Pssshhhhhhh! !! The result was tremendous! The balloon began blowing out its air, flying madly about, here and there, doing a thousand pirouettes, while the perfectly synchronised ants, made all kinds of beautiful shapes out of the string. Of course, that acrobatic flight ended with quite a hard landing, but it didn't matter. The originality and teamwork of the ant performance was so impressive that the crowd didn't even have to vote for there to be a winner. From then on, in that garden, everyone understood how much could be achieved by working together. In the years to come, the balloon competitions were full of displays carried out by teams, and they put on some wonderful routines; something those individual insects could never have achieved on their own.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Both of them were a bit flap-footed at it, but they had never let that get in the way of doing all they could to keep training and hopefully improve. One day, a new ram arrived at the farm. Soon after noticing the ducks' tightrope practice, he came over and began praising them. He said they were doing great, and he bet they could cross any precipice on that rope of theirs. This left billy feeling highly encouraged, despite artie commenting that he hadn't noticed any real improvement. A few days later, billy found himself with the ram, looking across a ravine. The gap was so wide that no one could jump it. You could only cross it using a tightrope. Artie tried to talk his friend out of it. He wanted him to realise that he wasn't such a great tightrope walker, and this thing with the ravine would be really dangerous. The ram disagreed, assuring them that billy peck was the best tightrope walker in the whole region, and that artie quack was just jealous of him. Both ducks got angry, and artie refused to help with the tightrope walk. On the ravine, the ram egged billy on, to reach the other side. But as soon as he had stepped out onto the rope billy lost his balance, and fell.

He saw that it couldn't have been easy for artie to tell him that he wasn't a good tightrope walker, and billy was grateful to have such a good friend who would always tell him the truth… and artie really was a good friend, because, knowing what was about to happen, he had gone straight off to find a group of wild ducks - old friends of his. These wild ducks flew much better than the poor old farm ducks. Artie prepared a rescue operation with the wild ducks. Billy asked artie to forgive him, and artie happily did so. And, while being rescued, and flying high, billy could see that over on the other side of the ravine there was a load of well-hidden and delicious delicacies. Billy realised that that was all the greedy ram had been interested in. He wanted those foods, but couldn't cross the ravine himself, so had tried to use billy to get them.

One time, ken and clive happened upon each other in a forest. Chatting and joking, time passed by quickly and they realised that it was so late that they would have to camp out in the forest that night. While they were sleeping, clive the magician sneezed with such magical violence that thousands of white-hot sparks shot out of his nose. Ken and clive had left their precious fleas on some leaves for the night and, unfortunately, one of the sparks landed on a leaf and the whole lot set alight. As the fire started spreading, the two magicians continued sleeping, and their fleas began to look decidedly nervous. They were all terribly clever and strong, so each one of the fleas thought of their own strategy to escape the fire. However, as they were still inside the bags, and they each jumped in all different directions, this meant that the bags stayed exactly where they were. One of the fleas noticed how they were all leaping in different directions, with no coordination. He realised that they would never escape like that. He stopped jumping, and gathered a group of fleas who he convinced to jump all at once. As they couldn't agree where to jump to, the flea suggested that they all jump first forward and then backward. The group started jumping together, and the rest of the fleas in the sack didn't take long to understand that jumping together would make it easier to escape the fire. So, soon all the fleas were jumping forwards, backwards, forwards, backwards… the fleas in the other bag saw this and imitated it. The two glass bags were now rolling backwards and forwards, towards each other, and with one last effort they collided and both bags shattered into a thousand pieces, setting the fleas free. By the time the fire had woken the magicians, it was already too late. Although they managed to put out the fire, their precious fleas had jumped far off into the night.

And so it was that they met the very first of the spark wizards, which were tiny little beings that shone intensely all over, as if they had somehow managed to swallow a star. Flint, as this spark wizard was known, turned out to be very nice and very charming, and when they asked him how he could be so joyful in the middle of such a ferocious storm, he replied with surprise:   -\"But why wouldn't I be happy when I've just escaped after two thousand years?\"He went on to explain how, thousands of years ago, the dark wizard had captured all the spark wizards and imprisoned them inside some big black clouds where he forced them to work as his slaves. It was almost impossible to escape that prison, but now and again, some of those clouds would collide, and with that impact little tufts of cloud would break off, allowing a spark wizard to escape.

A little later, his sister, angela, who was just a bit younger than him, asked him for the book so she could try reading it. After several days of trying to read it without great success, she appeared in the lounge, happily screaming,\"I've found it! I've found the key of the magic book!\" And she would not stop talking about all the worlds and places she had visited using that magic key. All the talk ended up convincing martin to resume reading the book. At first it was a pain; there wasn't even one miserable picture in the thing. But, gradually, the story started springing to life, and martin got interested in the adventurous prince's life. Then, suddenly, he was there. The book itself was the key!

Ever since he was a little boy, he never stopped searching for clues to investigate. Clues which might lead him to that place of wonder. He read hundreds of adventure books, histories, volumes of physics and chemistry; even music. Taking a little from here, a little from there, he arrived at quite a clear idea of what the island of inventions was really like. It was a secret place, where all the great wise men of the world would meet to learn and invent together. Access to the island was totally restricted. To be able to join that select club, you had to have created some great invention for humanity. Only then could you receive the unique and special invitation - which came with instructions on how to get to the island. To be in with a chance, luca spent the years of his youth studying and inventing. Every new idea he got, he made it into an invention, and if there were ever anything he didn't understand, he would seek out someone who could help him. Soon he met other young people, brilliant inventors too, and he told them of the secrets and marvels of the island of inventions. These fellow young inventors would likewise dream of being sent 'the letter', which is how the invitation was referred to. As time passed, the disappointment of not being sent the letter gave rise to even greater collaboration and mutual help between the young inventors. Their interesting individual inventions were put together, creating some incredible contraptions. They met in luca's house, which ended up looking like a huge warehouse for machines and spare parts. Their inventions became known throughout the world, and managed to improve every aspect of life. But even after all that, no invitation came. They did not lose heart. They continued learning and inventing every day, trying to come up with more and better ideas. Fresh young talent was added to their group, as more and more inventors dreamed of getting to the island. One day, a long time later, luca, already very old, was speaking with a brilliant young man who had written to him to try to join the group. Luca told the young man the great secret of the island of inventions, and of how he was sure that some day they would receive an invitation. Surprised, the young inventor interrupted luca:\"What? you mean this isn't really the island of inventions? isn't the letter you sent me the real invitation?\"And, as old as he was, luca looked around him, and realised that his dream had become true in his very own house. He realised that no island could exist which would be better than where he was now. No place of invention would be better than what he and his friends had created.

She wanted to be like the ladybirds and the beetles, and live a free and unworried life. The ant tried hard to make her dream a reality, and then finally, one windy day, she grabbed onto a big leaf that came flying past, and up they both went, higher and higher. When she was so high up that she could no longer make out the insects on the ground, she couldn't believe what came into view.

There was only the anthill. And the ant realised that it had been precisely those rules, the spirit of self-sacrifice, the obedience and effort of all the ants working together which had enabled them to build something so much greater than any other insect could.

But this spider didn't bother and thought, \"It will just a few paintings..\"With time more and more paintings were removed from basement but yet spider carried on reinforcing his web. He thought, \"Where am I going to find a better place than this??\"One morning museum employees took painting alongside which his web was built. Spider didn't want to leave his web but he realized that if he didn't leave his web right now then he would end up in exhibition room. In an act of strength and decisiveness, he chose to abandon his magnificent web, the web he had worked his whole life to build up. It was good decision as if he hadn't left then he would have been killed because of insect killer that were being sprayed on paintings. In his escape, after overcoming many difficulties, the spider ended up in a secluded little garden, where he found such a quiet corner that there he was able to spin an even better web and became a much happier spider.

He sent his workers in search of the bag, but none could find it. He told his friends and neighbors that he had lost a bag of gold coins and requested them to inform if they found it. Rohan was so sad that he had lost so many gold coins. After a couple of days, a ten year old girl, who was located near rohan's house, told her father that she had found a small bag and it had 50 gold coins. Her father worked in rohan's land.

When the king saw the sage standing, he ordered his army to be stopped. He came to the sage and said, \"Oh great sage, I am going to war to win another state so that my state can be expanded. so bless me to be victorious\". After thinking, sage gave a single currency coin to the king! The king was confused and annoyed with this because what use he has for a single coin while he is already one of the richest kings! He curiously asked a sage, \"What's the meaning of this one coin?\" A sage explained, \"Oh great king! I found this coin yesterday while strolling around the streets of your capital city. but I had no use of it. so, I had decided that I will donate it to someone needy. I strolled around till the evening in your capital, but found no one such. everyone was living a happy life. it seemed that they were satisfied with what they had. so I found no one to give this coin. but today, the king of this state, still have the desire to gain more and not satisfied with what he already has, I felt you were in need of this coin.\"The king realized his mistake and gave up the planned war.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

B) As such no activity of life should be seen as a distraction for living a spiritual life.

For most people who are still on the path, they should not let distractions them divert from spiritual path and focus intensely in our spiritual practice so that they become more centered inside. C) Do not attempt the impossible. D) Divinity lies within us all. We just need to look inside ourselves. E) It's our choice to keep positive attitude towards life.

A person, at his death, left three daughters; one handsome, and hunting for the men with her eyes; the second, an industrious spinner of wool, frugal, and fond of a country life; the third, given to wine, and very ugly. Now the old man made their mother his heir, on this condition, that she should distribute his whole fortune equally among the three, but in such a manner that they should not possess or enjoy what was given them; and further, that as soon as they should cease to have the property which they had received, they should pay over to their mother a hundred thousand sesterces. The rumour spreads all over athens. The anxious mother consults the learned in the law. No one can explain in what way they are not to possess what has been given, or have the enjoyment of it; and then again, in what way those who have received nothing, are to pay money. After a long time had been wasted, and still the meaning of the will could not be understood, the parent, disregarding the strict letter of the law, consulted equity. For the wanton, she sets aside the garments, female trinkets, silver bathing-vessels, eunuchs, and beardless boys: for the worker in wool, the fields, cattle, farm, labourers, oxen, beasts of burden, and implements of husbandry: for the drinker, a store-room, well stocked with casks of old 413 wine, a finely finished house, and delightful gardens.

He nearly always went about on his own because, although he wanted to have lots of friends, he was too self-conscious. One day, the octopus was trying to catch a very slippery oyster. Before he knew it, he had tied himself into one massive knot, and he couldn't move. He tried with all his strength to wriggle free, but it was no good. In the end, despite the great embarrassment he felt at being seen in such a tangle, he had to ask for help from the passing fish. Many fish swam past, ignoring him, but one very kind little fish offered to help to untie all those tentacles from all those suckers. The octopus felt heartily relieved when he was finally set free, but he was so shy that he didn't dare talk to the fish and make friends with him. He simply thanked the fish, and quickly swam off. Later, the octopus spent the whole night thinking that he had wasted a great opportunity to make friends with that very kind little fish. A couple of days later the octopus was resting between some rocks, when he noticed that everyone around was hurriedly swimming past. He looked into the distance and saw an enormous fish coming over to feed in that area. The octopus quickly hid; then, peeping an eye out from his hiding place, he saw that the huge fish was chasing the kind little fish who had untied him. That little fish really needed urgent help, but the big fish was so dangerous-looking that no one dared to go near. The octopus, remembering how the little fish had helped him, felt that he had to do whatever he could to come to his aid. Without hesitating, the octopus shot out from the rocks, like a ray. He put himself right in the path of the giant fish, and before the fish could do anything about it, the octopus had shot out the biggest jet of ink of his life. He grabbed the little fish, and swam off back to hide in the rocks. Everything happened so fast that the big fish had no time to react. However, he soon recovered from the surprise. Off he went to the rocks, looking for the octopus and the little fish. Now he really wanted to gobble them down! Soon, though, he began feeling a terrible itch; first in his gills, and then in his fins, and then all over his body. It turned out that this giant fish had a very artistic nature, he adored colours; and the octopus's dark ink had given him a terrible allergy!! So the big fish swam away, irritated all over. As soon as he was gone, all the fish who had been hiding came and congratulated the octopus for being so brave. Then the little fish told them all how he had helped the octopus a few days earlier, but he had never known anyone be so grateful that they would end up doing something so dangerous. Hearing this, the other fish discovered how nice the shy octopus was, and everyone around was keen to be the friend of such a brave and honourable octopus.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

That night, he took his waste-paper basket and went to the man's house. The first man also happened to be looking out the window, and saw what happened. Later, when he was picking up the papers which had been dumped on his porch, he found the important piece of paper that he had lost. It was torn into dozens of pieces. He thought that his neighbour had not only picked his pocket, but had had the cheek to mess up his doorway with rubbish. He didn't want to say anything. Instead, he started plotting his revenge. That night he phoned a farmer to make an order of ten pigs and a hundred ducks. He asked that they be delivered to his neighbour's house. Of course, the next day, his neighbour had quite a bit of trouble trying to rid himself of so many animals and their accompanying pong. Sure that this had been a dastardly trick pulled by his neighbour, as soon as the second man had gotten rid of the pigs and ducks, he again started planning his revenge. And so it went on.

The dropping of that single piece of paper ended up invoking a rock band, a fire siren, the driving of a lorry into a garden fence, the throwing of a hail of stones at windows, the firing of a canon, and finally the dropping of a bomb which destroyed both men's houses. Both ended up in a hospital, and had to spend quite some time sharing a room there. At first they refused to speak to each other, but, one day, tired of the silence, they got to talking.

Another bully wanted to take one of tony's toys. Instead of giving him it in fear, tony gave the boy a small card written by a policeman he knew. It read    -\"If you rob this boy I'll come after you and I'll even lock you up.\" The tactic worked. Just like tony had been afraid of their beatings, those big kids too were afraid of many things. On one occasion, a bully hit him a couple of times, and tony had to be brave and carry out his warning. The bully got such a fright that from that day he preferred to protect tony. So, in the end, tony became like the wasp he'd seen. Without even having to sting anyone, he frightened them, and ensured that no one would mess with him.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

No one had ever returned from there, and whenever anyone got lost and ended up there, the last that was heard was a great cry of terror, followed by a few enormous guffaws. The townsfolk lived in terror that one day the monster would leave the cave. So they regularly left gifts and food at the mouth of the cave, and these always soon disappeared. One day, a young man came to town, and, as he heard about the situation with the cave, he thought that it was unfair. So he decided to enter the cave and confront the monster. The young man asked for some help, but everyone was so afraid that not a single person approached the mouth of the cave with him. He went inside, finding his way with a torch, and calling out to the monster, wanting to talk with it and discuss the situation. At first, the monster had a good long laugh, and the young man followed the sound of the monster's voice. But then the monster went quiet, and the young man had to carry on, not knowing in which direction to go. Finally he arrived at a huge cavern. At the bottom of the cavern he thought he could make out the figure of the monster, and as he approached it, he felt that something hit him hard on his back. This pushed him forward towards a hole in the rock. He couldn't avoid it, and fell through. Believing that he was about to die, he let out one last cry. Then he heard the great guffaws. -\"Darn it, I think the monster has swallowed me,\" He said, whilst falling. However, as he fell, he heard music, and voices. They got clearer, and when he made a soft landing at the bottom, he heard a group of people shout:    -\"Surprise!!\"Hardly believing it, he found himself right in the middle of a big party. The partygoers were all those people who had never returned to the town. They explained to him that this place had been the idea of an old mayor of the town. That mayor had tried to accomplish great things, but was always held back by the fears of the people around him. So the mayor invented the story of the monster to demonstrate to people how such an attitude was so limiting. So the young man stayed there, enjoying the party and the company of all those who had dared to approach the cave. And what about the town?

His face looked very sad indeed. He tried smiling and making funny faces, but his reflection continued with its sad expression. Surprised, the boy went off to buy sweets. He came home as happy as can be, to look in the mirror, but his image was still sad-looking. He bought all kinds of toys and old junk, but forever looked sad in that mirror. Fed up, the boy stuck the mirror off in a corner. \"Crikey, what a terrible mirror! it's the first time I've seen a mirror that didn't work properly!\"That same afternoon he went into the street to play and to buy a few toys, but on his way to the park he saw a little boy who was crying his heart out. The boy was crying so much, and looked so lonely, that the rich boy went over to help him and to see what had happened. The little one told him that he had lost his parents. Together the two boys set off in search of them. As the little boy wouldn't stop crying, our boy spent his money on buying him sweets to cheer him up. Finally, after much walking, they found his parents who were out looking for him, very worried. The rich boy said goodbye, and walked off towards the park. But, seeing the time, he decided to turn round and head for home, without having been able to play, without toys, and without money. At home, he went to his room, and noticed a shining light in the corner; the same corner he had left the mirror in. Seeing this, he went over to the mirror, and realised that the light was coming from his own body, so radiant with happiness he had become.

Each day she would wake up in the burger bar, and patiently wait her turn to be cooked by the chefs, before being served to the customers. While being eaten, she would do everything possible to make herself really delicious, and with the customer's final bite she would feel like the lights had gone out and she had simply fallen asleep. The next day the whole process would repeat itself. The little burger could have continued quietly living this way for many years if it hadn't been for the fact that, one day, while she was waiting her turn at the cooking range, she heard one of the customers referring to her as \"Junk food\". And, boy, did this make her angry! She was so furious that she almost spontaneously combusted. From then on she realised that many people used that term about her and her sisters. And after listening closely to any radio or television program about junk food or healthy food, she arrived at a horrifying conclusion: it was true, she was \"Junk food\". Now she understood why most of her favourite customers were now much fatter than they had been when she first met them, and why those who came most often didn't look too well. The burger felt terrible; all this was her fault! So she tried to find some solution, some way they could shake off that terrible name. And then she hit on it. Whenever she saw one of the kids who visited almost daily, she would choose the best place to be chosen, and would wait to be served. Once he was with the child, and the important moment wasn't far off - the first bite - the burger would concentrate as much as she could and… nothing happened. The child sank their teeth into the burger and chewed the mouthful just as usual. Then along came another bite, with the burger concentrating as before, but everything happened just as before… several more bites and the burger was about to give up, when she heard the child's voice:   -\"Blimey, how strange! this burger doesn't taste of anything.\"That was just the start of what turned out to be a perfect plan. The burger convinced all her sisters not to have any flavour whenever they were with a customer that visited too often, in return for being even more tasty when the customer came only rarely. In this way they began to see fewer chubby, unhealthy-looking faces in the restaurant, and many of their old familiar friends started looking much better, while getting to eat much tastier burgers. And these burgers became much more popular from then on, because, everywhere, it's more enjoyable to taste something after a while of not having had it.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

All her spells were a disaster, and she couldn't find anyone to teach her how to put her goodness into action. So the little witch was sad most of the time. One day she heard that the old witches were planning to cast a spell on a big mountain and turn it into a volcano, which would destroy a small town.

When she went to speak to the townsfolk to warn them, they threw her out and pelted her with stones, shouting    -\"Get away from here, witch!\"The little witch ran off, and sat crying at the side of the road.

It was the perfect home for all types of little insects. They had to be careful of just one thing while living there: to ensure the plughole remained free from obstruction because otherwise they might all drown if rain fell suddenly. The burly beetles were put in charge of keeping an eye on the plughole to make sure that it was never blocked. However, one day disaster struck. The plughole was blocked by something huge, something gigantic - a watermelon! The watermelon was so big that not even the biggest beetle, not even the five biggest, could shift it. In fact, it was so big that not even all of the beetles working together could move the watermelon from the plughole! All the strongest insects tried their very best to move the watermelon but couldn't budge it even the tiniest bit. The smartest insects then tried to use their brains to come up with a way to move the watermelon but they had no luck either. Eventually, the wisest insects started to plan the escape from the bathtub. Amidst all the sadness, a ridiculous foreign ant had the cheek to ask if she could take the watermelon away with her. Very funny, indeed! It took a lot of insects to calm the beetles down and stop them from crushing the funny little ant. But the ant wasn't joking at all! At the end of the day, she returned, this time with thousands upon thousands of other ants. In perfect order, each ant went up to the watermelon, bit off a piece and walked off with it. \"You're not going to get anywhere by doing that\" Said a grasshopper to one ant that stopped for a second to rest. \"The watermelon is exactly the same as it was before you bit your piece off!\"\"Hmmm, are you sure about that?\" The ant responded in a funny accent, as if it had never occurred to her. Then, without giving it another thought, she resumed her journey. However, that little piece must have had an effect. Just a few days later, there was not a single trace of the giant watermelon. From that day on, many of the most difficult jobs in the bathtub became small ones that were easier to carry out little by little.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

But, with all that pent up energy, the games got rather rowdy, and a woodpecker ended up drilling a hole in the bottom of the ark. As water began entering the boat, the hole got bigger. So, more water came in, and things got a bit worrying. One by one, different animals tried to fix the hole. They even got competitive about it because everyone wanted to be the animal that had saved the ark. The beaver built a dam over the hole, but not even that worked. Everyone was scared, worried that the boat would sink. That was, until the bee started talking. The bee explained to everyone how it was that bees always worked together, as a team, each one doing the job they were best at. On hearing this, all the animals set about working together, each one playing their part by contributing their own special talent. The birds grabbed onto parts of the ark with their beaks, and flapped their wings furiously, lifting the boat up a little. The elephants sucked up the water in their trunks and shot it back into the sea. The fastest animals ran here and there, collecting materials. Those used to making nests took this material and stuffed it quickly into the hole. And so, working together, the animals managed to reduce the amount of water coming into the ark, but they still hadn't stopped it completely. Desperate, they kept asking each other if there were any other animals that could help. They searched and searched, but there were no other animals left in the ark. Then, suddenly, a little fish swam in through the hole. The animals realised that they still had not asked for help from all the sea creatures. They asked the little fish to go and summon help to save their boat. He swam off and soon fish after fish arrived at the ark.

So, amanda and her father got up when it was still dark, took their torches, and carefully made their way to the beach. Her father made her promise to respect the baby turtles, not to make any noise, and to do what he told her. Well, amanda was willing to do almost anything if it meant that she could go and see the turtles hatch. She didn't really know what it would be like, but her older brother had told her that the turtles are born on the beach just a few metres from the water's edge. After hatching they quickly scuttle towards the sea. All that sounded very exciting to her. Crouching quietly, by the light of only one of the torches on a low setting, amanda and her daddy waited. She looked all over, hoping to see mother turtle, and she almost missed the appearance of the first baby turtle. It was so tiny! It moved very clumsily, like most babies; and without waiting for either its brothers or sisters or mother, it started to scuttle towards the sea. Gradually, more and more baby turtles appeared, and all ran towards the water. Amanda and her daddy stayed hidden and quiet, watching the wonderful spectacle of that crazy race to the sea. But then something happened which, to amanda, seemed horrible. Some seagulls and other birds arrived, and they started eating some of the little turtles. She kept looking everywhere to see whether daddy turtle would turn up to give those birds a good hiding. But he never came. Amanda was watching all this with tears in her eyes, and when the first group of baby turtles finally reached the water and were safe from the birds, she gave out a little cry of happiness. Even with the birds eating quite a few little turtles, in the end many more reached the sea, and amanda was very pleased that they had managed to do so. On their way home, her father, who had noticed the tears in amanda's eyes, explained to her that turtles were born that way. Mother turtle lays many eggs, hides them in the sand, and off she goes. When the baby turtles hatch out, they have to try to reach the sea on their own. That's why so many are born, because lots of them get eaten by other animals, and not only on the sand, also in the water. He explained to her that the few turtles who manage to become adults live for many, many years.

Nearly all dragons decided while they were still young, and trained for years before the big change. But brodek was undecided. And now time had run out. At dawn, his wings would be covered with the dark blue of night or the gold of the sun, and so they would remain forever, and everything would be hatred for the sun or for the moon, without remedy. This was the price of the magic and terrible gift of breathing fire. Because of all this, brodek went to the forest to think, where he hoped to find an answer. But there, sitting in the silence of the night, there were no answers. Just a beautiful white full moon, with pale silver shimmer. And the wind in the leaves of the trees was softer and cooler than usual, as if saying farewell to the young dragon. And night, a deep night full of distant stars …for nothing in the world did brodek want to become a dragon of light in order to hate all that wonder, and he felt his wings slowly begin to dye into the colour of the night. But the night was losing its strength and making way for the first light of dawn.

And before tears flooded his eyes, before even knowing the final colour of his wings, brodek flew to the lake, dove in as deep as he could to quench his thirst for peace, and then turned and flew up into the sky, as high as he could, as if trying to escape from the unjust land and his cruel fate. And when he had flown so high that the cold prevented him from moving his wings, he opened his mouth to spit out a great flame, as if to spend it completely, to never have it again. But instead of fire, from his mouth came a thin layer of frost that covered the fields below, as if his desire for peace and the lake water had worked a miracle. And only then did he discover that he wouldn't be a dragon of the darkness, and neither would he be a dragon of the light, since now one of his wings belonged to the moon, and the other to the sun.

Even the slightest annoyance would turn his face as red as a chilli. And so it was, that one day something truly ridiculous happened to alfie, something which almost made him explode with embarrassment. He was with his friend jamie, practicing for a play jamie was going to be in: the three little pigs. After a while spent rehearsing the play, alfie remembered that he'd invited dora to his house that afternoon. Dora was the sweetest, prettiest, cleverest girl in his class. Alfie ran straight to the playground, found dora, and said to her,\"What do you reckon? should we go to my place? I can give you a sausage sandwich…\"And just as he finished saying this, he realised that he had forgotten to remove the mask and costume of the little pig! Dora was speechless. Everyone in the playground started laughing, and poor alfie, unable to react, just thought, \"Earth, swallow me up!\"Suddenly, alfie disappeared into the ground, and found himself in an incredible place. Everyone in that place had wanted the earth to swallow them up! And it was no surprise at all, because the faces of the people there were all covered with expressions of utter embarrassment. Alfie met an athlete who had run a race in the wrong direction, and had thought he had won it by a huge distance. He met a bald young lady whose wig had blown off during a storm, and he met a bride who had stepped on the train of her wedding dress, and ended up rolling about like a meatball. Soon, alfie found out that the only way to escape from that place was through laughter. But not just any kind of laughter; you could only escape by learning to laugh at yourself. It wasn't easy, some folk had spent years there, under the earth, refusing to find anything amusing about their own embarrassment. But alfie managed to overcome this, and learned how to find the humour in those moments of shame and embarrassment. He also learned to use them in a way that made others laugh, and bring them a little joy. When he remembered himself in the little pig mask, talking about sausage sandwiches with dora, he couldn't stop laughing at the whole situation. As soon as he realised all this, alfie was instantly returned to the playground, in front of dora, just where he had left her. But this time, far from getting embarrassed and tongue-tied, he smiled at her, took off his little piggy mask, wiggled his little piggy bottom, and said,\"Come on, cheer up! today I have great ham in store!\" Dora and the others laughed, and from that day on, alfie became one of the funniest kids at school, able to make himself and others laugh at whatever happened to them.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

On that first day, when ricky went to sleep, he had left his bedroom in a truly disastrous state. When he woke up the next morning, everything was perfectly clean and tidy. In fact, it was actually \"Too\" Clean; now ricky couldn't find his favourite t-shirt, nor his favourite toy. However much he searched, the two items did not reappear, and the same was starting to happen with other things. Ricky cast a suspicious eye on the gleaming butler robot. He hatched a plan to spy on the robot, and began following it around the house. Finally he caught it red-handed, picking up one of ricky's toys to hide it. Off he went, running to his parents, to tell them that the butler was broken and badly programmed. Ricky asked them to have it changed. But his parents told him absolutely not; it was impossible, they were delighted with the new butler, and it cooked like a dream. So ricky needed to get some kind of proof; maybe take some hidden photos. He kept on at his parents, about how much good stuff the robot was hiding. This outweighed however good a cook it was, ricky argued. One day, the robot was whirring past, and heard the boy's complaints. The robot returned with one of the boy's toys, and some clothes for him. \"Here, sir. I did not know it was bothering you,\" Said the butler, with its metallic voice. \"How could it not, you thief?! you've been nicking my stuff for weeks!\" The boy answered, furiously. \"The objects were left on the floor. I therefore calculated that you did not like them. I am programmed to collect all that is not wanted, and at night I send it to places other humans can use it. I am a maximum efficiency machine. were you unaware?\" The robot said, with a certain pride. Ricky started feeling ashamed. He had spent all his life treating things as though they were useless. He looked after nothing. Yet it was true that many other people would be delighted to treat those things with all the care in the world. And he understood that the robot was neither broken nor misprogrammed, rather, it had been programmed extremely well! Since then, ricky decided to become a 'maximum efficiency boy', and he put real care into how he treated his things. He kept them tidy, and made sure he didn't have more than was necessary.

The monster took a step backwards, grabbed its multicoloured hair with its tentacles and… started crying! The monster cried for so long that the boy's shock and fear subsided. He calmed the monster as much as he could, and started talking to him, asking him why he was crying, and what he was doing there. The monster told him he lived in the wardrobe, but almost never went out, because he was afraid of the boy. When the boy asked him why, the monster told him the boy's face seemed to him the most horrible thing he'd ever seen with eyes, ears and a nose. The boy felt exactly the same way about the monster, who had an enormous head full of mouths and hair. The two of them talked so much that they became quite friendly, and they realised that both of them had been afraid of the same thing: the unknown. To lose their fear all they had to do was get to know each other. Together they travelled the world, seeing lions, tigers, crocodiles, dragons… it was the first time either of them had seen such creatures, but they made the effort to get to know them, and ended up dispelling their fear, and becoming friends. And, although his parents weren't too happy, because they thought he was too old to still believe in monsters, the truth of it was that all kinds of creatures visited the boy's bedroom each night. And, instead of fearing them he had learned to get to know them and befriend them.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

His parents, teachers, and many others, said he didn't know how to lose, but the truth of it was that he couldn't stand losing, not even at marbles. It was so great, and he felt so good, when he won, that he never wanted to give up that feeling; not for anything in the world. On top of that, losing made him feel precisely the opposite. It seemed to pete that losing was the worst thing that could happen to anyone. If there was a game pete wasn't brilliant at, he simply wouldn't play it. But if he was going to win he would take part, even if the game lasted only a minute. And the kind of things he was really good at, like table football, you could hardly stop him playing. A new kid started at pete's school, and his name was albert. Albert was a cracking table football player, and it didn't take pete and albert long before they challenged each other to a game. Pete prepared for the match with great seriousness. He was concentrated and intense. Albert, on the other hand, seemed not to be taking the thing at all seriously. He walked about the whole time, smiling and cracking jokes about all sorts of things. But on the football table, albert was a real phenomenon. He scored goals again and again, laughing and joking all the time. However, albert was paying so little attention to the match that pete managed to change the scoreboard while his opponent was looking elsewhere, and so pete managed to win by cheating. Pete made a big thing of his win, but it seemed not to matter to albert. - \"It's been fun. we should play again some other time\", said albert. On that day, people at school talked about little else. Pete's great victory was on everyone's lips. But, that night, pete didn't feel so happy. He had won, but even with that there was no trace of the joyful feeling he usually enjoyed so much. What's more, albert hadn't felt bad about losing. He almost seemed to enjoy it. And, to top it all, the next day pete saw albert playing basketball. He was absolutely hopeless; he lost time after time. But that happy smile never left his face. For several days pete watched the new guy. He was great at some things, terrible at others - to an embarrassing degree - but he enjoyed everything equally. Pete began learning that to enjoy a game you didn't have to have a scoreboard; nor did you have to have winning and losing. What you had to do was enjoy the game for its own sake, trying to do well, and enjoying each aspect of it. Finally, pete found himself playing hide and seek, telling a joke while playing table football, and regretting that a particularly fun game he was playing was soon about to end. And without really knowing why, the older kids started commenting amongst themselves, - \"Good fun playing with pete, that kid sure isn't a sore loser.\"\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Normally, it showed one of the old kings, with sceptre in hand, standing next to his son and some members of the court. But the king had disappeared from the painting. The boy was very worried by this, and he thought he must have made some mistake; but a while later he walked past the painting once more, and noticed that the sceptre had been left there by the king, and was leaning over. The boy was intrigued. Even more so when, soon after, he saw that the angle of the sceptre had increased. At that rate, in a few hours it would end up hitting the prince on the head. So the boy started looking throughout the castle for the missing king. Finally, he found him in one of the castle bathrooms, quietly enjoying a wonderful bubble bath in the biggest bathtub in the whole building. The boy was speechless. On seeing his shock, the king explained to him that he had spent years and years hanging on the walls of that castle, and no one had cleaned the dust off him; not even once. He had gotten so dirty that he couldn't stand it a second more, and had had to run off to get a bath. When the boy had recovered from the surprise, he respectfully explained to the king what was about to happen with the sceptre and the prince.

He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils. He told them that, in the beginning, men were nomads; that they never stayed in the same place for very long. Instead, they would travel about, here and there, in search of food, wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out, they would move off somewhere else. He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals. This was an important discovery, because by learning to cultivate the land, and care for animals, mankind would always have food readily available. It also meant that people could remain living in one place, and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete, like building towns, cities, and all that was in them. All the children were listening, spellbound by this story, until lucy jumped up:\"And if that was so important, and improved everything so much, why are we nomads all over again, mister arnold?\"Mister arnold didn't know what to say. Lucy was a very intelligent girl. He knew that she lived with her parents in a house, so she must know that her family were not nomads; so what did she mean? \"We have all become nomads again,\" Continued lucy, \"The other day, outside the city, they were cutting the forest down. a while ago a fisherman told me how they fish. it's the same with everyone: when there's no more forest left the foresters go elsewhere, and when the fish run out the fishermen move on. that's what the nomads did, isn't it?\" The teacher nodded, thoughtfully. Really, lucy was right. Mankind had turned into nomads. Instead of looking after the land in a way that we could be sure it would keep supplying our needs, we kept exploiting it until the land was bare and barren. And then off we would go to the next place! The class spent the rest of the afternoon talking about what they could do to demonstrate how to be more civilised…the next day everyone attended class wearing a green t-shirt, with a message that said \"I am not a nomad!\"And, from then on, they set about showing that indeed they were not.

On arriving at the new place, she discovered a huge attic full of old junk. In one pile she found a big chest containing all kinds of strange things. Under them all, she found something special. It was an old book with a great heavy, thick cover, with gold writing on it. But what made it truly special was how it shone in the darkness of that attic, and in the most magical, fantastical way. What's more, the book was actually floating in the air. Peggy could find nothing holding it up. She took the book down to her room and hid it there until nighttime, putting her puppy on guard duty over it. That night, when she was sure no one would disturb her, she sat with her doggy and started reading the book. It was a storybook, but peggy could hardly get any of it read. She had only just started when her dog started speaking to her:\"What an interesting book you've found! it seems to have some lovely stories!\" Peggy couldn't believe it, but the puppy continued talking, telling her all sorts of things, and asking a thousand questions.

The worst thing was that lewis had started calling her 'four eyes', and as he was a very popular member of the class, the nickname stuck. Now everyone knew her as suzy four eyes. She acted like she didn't mind, but in fact susannah couldn't stand it. One day, the class went on a school outing to visit some famous caves. The children were walking towards the caves, when lewis put his foot in a hole and slipped. While falling, he grabbed onto susannah, who was walking next to him, and both plummeted down the hole, out of sight. After some time they landed in a very big dark, cave. All that could be seen was a single ray of light coming from the cave roof, many metres above, and some tree roots and trunks which had fallen through the hole. Susannah and lewis shouted for help, but no one came. Crouched together in the deathly cold of the cave, they endured a long dark night. The next morning they still hadn't been found, and without the small ray of light from above, they wouldn't have been able to see anything at all.

Quickly, she took a piece of wood that had fallen into the cave, and, using her glasses as a magnifying glass, she focused the ray of light onto the wood until a little flame sprang up. Now they had a torch. Lewis watched all this with surprise and excitement. He grabbed some more branches, and off they went together, to explore the cave. It took them some time, and they had to burn quite a few torches, but finally they found a way out. Amid hugs and cries of relief, lewis gave susannah his heartfelt thanks. He knew that she couldn't stand people calling her four eyes, and now he regretted having given her that name. Especially seeing that it was her glasses that had saved them both.

The hedgehog realised that surely only he himself had seen this, so he decided to try to save the martian. He called together a few animals to help.

Now, scamp was a very happy little fish, and he wasn't going to give up so easily. He asked and asked, swam and swam, and finally he started jumping in and out of the water. The river, feeling all the jumping and splashing, started to laugh. It tickled! After a while, this put the river in such a good mood that he started talking to scamp. Almost without knowing it, by the end of that day, scamp and the river had become very good friends. The river spent that night thinking about how much fun it was to have friends, and how much he had missed by not having them. He asked himself why he had never had them, but he couldn't remember. The next morning, scamp woke the river with a few playful splashes… and that was when the river remembered why he had decided to be such an unfriendly river: he remembered that he was very ticklish, and that he wouldn't have been able to stand it! Now he remembered perfectly how he had told everyone to scoot, that he wasn't going to put up with all that tickling. But, remembering how sad and lonely he had felt for so many years, the river realised that although it may sometimes be a bit inconvenient or uncomfortable, it was always better to have friends and to try to be happy.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Hours later, andy finally decided to go to bed. But what a surprise when he entered his bedroom! Tubby was in his bed, totally sprawled out, pot-belly in the air, and snoring like an express train. Andy tried to shift the cat, but there was no way of moving him an inch. That night he hardly slept a wink, being pushed over into one tiny corner of his bed.

She ran everywhere looking for someone who was crying, and she came upon a little girl who was weeping disconsolately. Sure enough, her tears were converted into chocolate, and as they ran down her cheeks, to her mouth, they sweetened her lips. That soon stopped her crying.

When they had finished doing the big toys it was time to sort the little stuff. However, they had already taken so long that it was time for bed, so they left the small toys for the next day.

The fairy warned them of the dangers and difficulties that lay ahead, of how hard it would be to endure the whole journey, but none of her followers were afraid. They all promised to accompany her to wherever it was needed, and that same day the fairy and her fifty most loyal followers set out on their journey.

Shadow was by no means the bravest, he was not the best fighter, nor was he the most quick-witted or the most fun. However, what he did do was stay loyal to the fairy, right to the very end.

The powerful magic of the crystal stone meant that the fairy could return to the lake and make the evil beings disappear. But every night she would cry at the absence of her loyal shadow, because from shadow's act of self-sacrifice had arisen a love stronger than any other.

Doctor bear, the forest physician, would shake his head, telling people:    -\"This can't be good. animals don't wear clothes; we don't need them.\" But no one listened to him, they said he was just old-fashioned, and ignorant of the latest trends. However, it wasn't long before the first consequences of fashion-fever began to take effect. Several times the squirrel snagged his shirt on tree bark, stopping him in mid-leap, and sending him plummeting to the ground from a great height. The mole tried to fit into his hole without first taking his hat off. He was stuck in that hole all day. One of the birds got in a tangle with the clothes it was wearing, and had to make a crash-landing on some thistles, getting stuck full of thorns. Even the racoon, thanks to his brightly coloured socks, slipped from one of the river rocks and almost drowned. When the casualties came to see doctor bear, he gave them all the same prescription:    -\"Off with you, and get rid of those clothes, because one day they're going to kill you.\" Those who listened to the doctor's advice stopped having accidents. And the animals realised that they didn't need clothes at all. Starting to wear them had been very silly, and they had only done it to make others envious of them, and to get attention.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

It was time for the scuttleball world championship. Scuttleball was soccer for ants; and it was definitely their favourite sport. Ants of all shapes and sizes, from every nook and cranny in the world, had arrived. There were teams of red ants, black ants, flying ants, termites… and even some bizarre multicoloured ants. And, of course, every team had its own loyal band of supporters. As the tournament went on the excitement only increased, and the supporters got more and more devoted to their own particular team. Before long, the inevitable happened. In the stand a black ant shouted \"Midgets!\" At a group of red ants. The red ants answered with a bit of pushing and shoving, and almost instantly the whole thing turned into a great big ball of legs, jaws, and antennae. In the end, thousands of ants were in hospital, and the tournament had to be suspended. No one can deny that there's almost always trouble when different kinds of ant get together. But this time things had gone too far, so a meeting of ant elders was called. The elders discussed the matter for days, trying to reach a solution which would end this kind of trouble once and for all. Finally, they came to a decision: \"We believe that ants of all teams are equal. it seems, though, that this tournament is being used to try to prove which kind of ant is the best. we know that all the different types of ant are indeed pretty impressive. therefore, we say that comparisons should not be made, and that from this day on every scuttleball team will be made up of different kinds of ant\". That decision caused quite a commotion, but soon the crowds of ants started forming themselves into new teams, mixed teams, and each ant was free to choose which team he would support. The tension on the terraces was reduced, and the ants began to see that they could enjoy the matches without so much arguing. N. B.

One day, toby came to her restaurant, ready for a nosh. Toby was a great big toad, and certainly wasn't the brightest. When fran's fine creations were brought before him he complained, saying that that wasn't food, and that what he really wanted was a botfly burger. Fran came out of the kitchen to see what the problem was, and toby told her that these dishes weren't good enough for - and certainly wouldn't fill - a smooth newt. This made fran so offended, and furious, that she went to the kitchen, came back with a frying pan, and whacked toby squarely on the forehead. A slight scuffle ensued. Even though fran realised she should have controlled her temper, and she kept asking toby to forgive her, the toad was so angry that he said he could only forgive her if she handed him the frying pan so he could hit her back. Everyone tried to calm toby down, knowing full well that, given his strength, he could easily crack little fran's head open with that frying pan. Toby would not accept an apology, and fran felt awful for having bashed him, so she tried everything. She gave him a special cream for bruises, she poured him an exquisite puddlewater liqueur. Even better than that, she cooked him a…  beautiful botfly burger! But toby the toad still insisted he would not be satisfied until he got to return the blow he had received. It had reached the stage where he was almost getting out of control. Then a very old toad entered the restaurant, shuffling along with the help of two crutches. - wait toby, - said the old toad -you can give her a whack after I've broken your leg. Remember that you are the reason why I have to walk with these crutches. Toby didn't know what to say. He recognised the old toad. It was reddit, his old teacher. When toby was small, reddit had saved him from a bunch of young hooligans. In the process, reddit had lost a leg. Toby remembered that it had all happened because he had been highly disobedient, but he had never given a thought to reddit until now…toby now realised he was being very unfair to fran. Everyone, including himself, made mistakes sometimes. And if we are to return blow for blow, wound for wound, all we are doing is prolonging the damage. So, even though his head still hurt and he thought fran had made quite a remarkable mistake with that frying pan, seeing her feeling so sorry, and doing everything she could to put things right, toby decided to forgive her.

The ladybirds had been pushed to the verge of extinction when, while being led by their famous guide, caius insectus, a storm flooded the path they were travelling. Caius insectus disappeared into the flood, and the few ladybirds who survived had to choose a new guide and leader. They decided that their new leader would be the first ladybird to successfully travel south to the great lake and return to describe it. Many young ladybirds eagerly launched themselves into this adventure. One by one they returned and told of how beautiful the southern lake was at that time of year, with its crystal clear waters, bordered by flowered meadows. However, the last of the ladybirds was late in getting back. They waited for him for three days, and when he finally returned, he was downcast and embarrassed. He hadn't managed to reach the lake. Everyone criticised him for his slowness and stupidity, and they prepared to continue their journey the next day. Following their new guide, they spent a morning walking northwards until they reached some tall thick grassland, where they halted, astonished. In front of them was the great lake! But there were no crystal clear waters, or flowered meadows. The heavy rain had turned it into a huge green puddle surrounded by mud. Everyone understood what had happened. Without realising it, they had been swept beyond the lake by the flood. When the ladybirds had gone out looking for the lake, they had gone in the wrong direction. Now they could see that, apart from that one late ladybird, they had all wanted to be the great guide, and they had not had any qualms to lie in order to get what they wanted. And so, the late little ladybird, the only one who they now really trusted, was made the great guide. They also decided that every time one of them was discovered lying they would paint a black spot on that ladybird's back, so there'd be no way to erase it. Nor would a ladybird know how many spots they had on their back. From then on, when a ladybird looks at another's back, it can tell whether that ladybird is trustworthy. Likewise, when people show themselves to be dishonest other people paint spots on their impressions of them. It's enough to have just one black spot to change from a simple red insect into a ladybird.

Clark was  a character from an ordinary comic, an intelligent kid, and that was it. But his classmates really were something special. Some were incredible superheroes, others were great wizards, or space travelers. And they all had such extraordinary powers that it made clark look like a simpleton. So spectacular were their abilities and adventures that the world of cartoon characters was a bit of a bore to them. -\"What a pain this is,\" They would say, -\"We always win here, and the villains are pitiful. we want real villains, so we can give them a taste of our powers!\"All this unnerved clark. How would they face the real world, knowing how difficult it was? But his classmates got their way, and one day they all woke up in the real world. This world was really dangerous, and when the characters tried to save it - using their superpowers - they realised the real world was under some sort of spell. It must have been a terrible spell because everything seemed back to front. It was impossible to teleport from place to place, fly through the air, or use your laser vision. Any little knock or bump was terribly painful, space weapons didn't work, and none of the spells they knew had any effect. How could they save the world if their powers were useless? But then clark came along. It seemed like the spell had no effect on him, because he was just as intelligent as ever. He instantly understood what was going on. Along with clark there were other characters that hadn't lost their qualities. These were normal characters: boys and girls who were happy, fun, creative, charming, hard-working and affectionate… and they were able to live just the same in the real world as they had in the comic world. And while their 'powerful' classmates could do nothing else but wonder what had happened to their powers, this new group of normal heroes put all their abilities into practice to help save the world from the current danger. And they were a great success, because the danger threatening the world was none other than the world filling up with children who spent their time doing nothing, expecting to be given some magical and mysterious power that would enable them to solve everything.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Finally, the hippo made his mind up that he would come out of the river, climb the tree, go out to perch on a branch, and start singing. However, when he tried to climb the tree it was all too clear that the hippo didn't have wings, nor claws to climb with, and neither could he hop. Realising that he would never manage it, he angrily rammed his whole weight against the tree until it came crashing to the ground. Then, triumphantly, he stepped onto the leaves of the fallen tree, and began singing. Unfortunately, hippos can't sing either. All that came from his mouth were horrible noises, and when the other animals heard this they all gathered round to make fun of the hippo standing on the branch of a fallen tree, trying to sing like a bird. He was so embarrassed by this that he decided to never again regret being a hippo. He also felt bad about having knocked the tree over.

When people stated their wish the object of their desire would appear in a cloud of dirt, covered in dust. So many, and so embarrassing were his botches that no one wanted him. His lamp ended up being used only to throw at people, just like a common old box; and the genie didn't come out of it for years, and became sad and depressed. That was, until a lonely boy found the lamp, and could hear the sad cries of the genie inside. So the boy decided to try to become the genie's friend, and the wish he asked to be granted was to be able to enter and leave the lamp, just like the genie could, so they could spend time together. The genie was happy to grant this wish, and as soon as the boy entered the lamp, he could see what the genie's problem was. It wasn't that he was a bad genie. It was just that he couldn't have been less tidy! In the lamp everything was thrown all over the place, whether it be jewellery, books, boats or camels. It was obvious that the place hadn't seen a duster for years. Being a genie, he had all sorts of stuff in there, and as the lamp was small, everything was crammed in together that whenever the genie tried to get something, a cloud of dust would fly up. The boy held his head in his hands, and the genie apologised, saying that a genie's job was very important and he hadn't had time for cleaning. But the boy remembered his mother's advice, and told the genie that the more important his job was, the more important it was that he keep all his things in order. And together they decided to give the place a good clean. It took them quite a few days, but when they finished, everything was gleaming and in its correct place. Now it was dead easy to find whatever gift was asked for, and to retrieve it without breaking anything. And so it was that the genie began to be respected and admired once more.

The clown went from town to town, earning a little money from his show. In that village he began his act in the square. While everyone was enjoying the show, a naughty boy started to make fun of the clown, telling him to leave the village. The shouts and insults made the clown nervous, and he dropped one of his juggling balls. Some others in the crowd started booing because of this mistake, and in the end the clown had to leave quickly. He ran off, leaving four of the juggling balls. But neither the clown nor his juggling balls were in any way ordinary. During that night, each one of the balls magically turned into a naughty boy, just like the one who had shouted the insults. All except one ball, which turned into another clown. For the whole of the next day, the copies of the naughty boy walked round the village, making trouble for everyone. In the afternoon, the copy of the clown started his juggling show, and the same thing happened as the previous day. But, this time, there were four naughty boys shouting, instead of one. Again, the clown had to run off, leaving another four balls behind. Once more, during the night, three of those balls turned into copies of the naughty boy, and one turned into a clown. And so the same story repeated itself for several days, until the village was filled with naughty boys who would leave no one in peace. The village elders decided to put an end to all this. They made sure that none of the naughty boys would disrespect or insult anyone. When the clown's show began, the elders prevented the boys even making a squeak. So the clown managed to finish his show, and could spend that night in the village. That night, three of the copies of the naughty boy disappeared, and the same happened until only the clown and the original naughty boy remained. The boy, and everyone in the village, had been shown just how far they could go. From then on, instead of running visitors away, that village made every effort to make sure that visitors would spend a nice day there. The villagers had discovered just how much a humble travelling clown can teach with his show.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

He was a small, slim kid, and he lived forever in fear because some boys from a neighboring village would harass poor leo and try to have fun at his expense. One day, a young wizard was passing by the village and saw leo being made fun of. When the other boys left, the wizard went over to leo and gave him a beautiful lion's tail, along with a small tie that allowed leo to hang the lion's tail from his belt. -\"It's a magic tail. when the person wearing it acts bravely, he or she will turn into a ferocious lion.\"Having seen the young wizard's powers some days earlier during his act, leo didn't doubt his words, and from that time on he wore the lion's tail hanging from his belt, hoping that the horrible kids would turn up so he could teach them a good lesson. But when the boys came along, leo was scared and he tried to run away. However, they soon caught him up and surrounded him. The usual jokes and pushing started, then leo felt the lion's tail hanging from his belt. Then, summoning up all his courage, leo tensed his body, made two fists, and looked up, fixedly into the eyes of each of the boys, and with all the calmness and ferocity in the world, he promised that if they didn't leave him alone at that instant one of them - even if it were only one - would regret it for ever… today, tomorrow, and any other day. He kept looking them in the eye, with his hardest expression, ready to do what he had promised. Leo felt goosebumps all over. This must be the sign that he was turning into a lion, because the looks on the boys' faces were definitely changing. They all took a step back, looked at each other, and finally ran off. Leo wanted to take off after them and give them a good beating with his new body, but when he tried to move, he felt his legs were short and just normal, so he had to abandon the idea. Not far off, the wizard observed, smiling. He ran over to leo. Leo was very happy, though a bit disappointed that his new lion body had lasted only a short time, and he hadn't managed to fight them. -\"You wouldn't have been able to anyway,\" The wizard told him, -\"No one fights with lions, because simply from seeing them, and knowing how brave and ferocious they are, everyone runs away. have you ever seen a lion fighting?\"It was true. Leo couldn't remember ever having seen a lion fighting. Leo became filled with thought, looking at the lion's tail. And he understood everything. There had been no magic, no transformation, no nothing. What happened was that a good friend had shown him that bullies and other cowardly animals never dare to confront a truly brave boy.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

A very poor bunny was walking sadly through the fields when, all of a sudden, a wizard appeared in front of him. The wizard offered the bunny a bag filled with little bouquets of flowers. \"They are magical, and they're even more magical if you know how to use them properly\", said the wizard. The bunny was dying of hunger, but he decided not to eat the bouquets. He wanted to put them to good use. On his way home, the bunny met a very old and very poor sheep who could hardly walk any more. \"Can you spare me something?\" Asked the sheep. The bunny had nothing except his bouquets, and since they were magical, he was reluctant to give them to the sheep. But he remembered how his parents had always taught him to share everything; so he pulled a bouquet out of the bag and gave it to the sheep. As soon as he did this, the bunch shone with a thousand colours. Magic was at work. The bunny continued on his way, feeling both happy and a bit annoyed. He had given away one of the bouquets, but at the same time it was obvious that the sheep needed it more than he did. As he continued his journey, the very same thing happened to the bunny when he met a blind duck and then a lame cockerel. When the bunny arrived home, he had only one magical bouquet left. He told his parents all about what had happened with the wizard, and his parents were very proud of the bunny's behaviour. He was about to pull out the final bouquet, when his little brother arrived home, crying with hunger. The bunny gave his brother the magical bouquet. At that moment, with a great rumble of thunder, the wizard appeared again. He asked the bunny \"Where are the magical bouquets I gave you? what have you done with them?\" The bunny was frightened and he started to apologise. But the wizard interrupted, saying \"Didn't I tell you that if you used them well they'd be even more magical? well, go outside and see what you've done!\"The bunny went out, shaking. And what he saw was that, thanks to the way he had used his magical bouquets, for as far as the eye could see the whole countryside had turned into wonderful, green farmland. Farmland with enough water and food to feed all the animals!

On the train was a strange guy with a big suitcase. He was called william warbler - the man, not the suitcase - and he looked very common indeed. What made him most unusual, though, was the fact that whenever he needed to communicate he did it by singing opera. It didn't matter to william whether it was simply a matter of answering a brief greeting, like 'good day'. He would clear his voice and respond,\"Gooood dayyy to youuuuuuuu….. toooooo!\"It wouldn't be unfair to say that almost everyone considered william warbler a massive pain in the neck. No one could get a normal, spoken, word out of him. And, as no one knew how he made his living - and he lived quite simply, always wearing his same old second-hand suit - they often treated him with disdain. They made fun of his singing, calling him 'don no one', 'poor-rotti', and 'lazy miserables'. William had been in cheekyville for some years, when, one day, a rumour spread round town like wildfire: william had secured a role in a very important opera in the nation's capital, and there were posters everywhere advertising the event. Everyone in the capital went to see it, and it was a great success. At the end of its run - to everyone in cheekyville's surprise -  when william was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great courtesy, and with a clears and pleasant voice. From that day, william gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others still had no idea, and continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn't have thought so if they had seen what william kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved message on it. The message said: \"Practice, my boy. practice every second, for you never know when your chance will come.\"Little did people realise that he only got the role in the opera because the director had heard william singing while out buying a newspaper.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

He knocked at the door several times, but no one answered. There was still a huge racket coming from inside, and the boy decided to just enter. When he opened the door there was total silence. Stepping inside, he saw thousands of shocked eyes looking back at him: vases, mirrors, paintings, chairs…  everything in that house was alive!

Seeing anyone happy bothered the crook enormously. What he hated most was when people were polite and courteous to each other, saying things like please and thank you, and don't mention it. It annoyed him even more if they were smiling when they said these things. The crook thought all those kinds of words were a useless waste, and weren't good for anything. So what he did was spend a lot of time inventing a machine which could steal words. With this machine, he planned to steal 'please', 'thank you', 'don't mention it', and similar words people used to be polite. He was convinced that no one would notice if those words were to suddenly disappear. When he had stolen these words, he intended to take them apart and sell the letters to book publishers. After he started up his machine, people would open their mouths, intending to say kind and polite things, but nothing came out. All those words ended up inside the big machine. Just as the crook had hoped, in the beginning nothing happened. It looked like people really didn't need to be polite after all. However, after a while, people started to feel like they were always in a bad mood, doing everything reluctantly, and feeling like everyone else was being forever demanding of them. So, within a few days, everyone was angry and arguing over the slightest little thing. The crook was terribly happy with his success, but he didn't count on a couple of very special little girls. Those girls were deaf, and had to communicate using sign language. Now, because the machine couldn't steal gestures, these girls continued being kind and polite. Soon they realised what had been happening to everyone else, and they found out about the crook and his wicked plan. The girls followed him to his hideout on the top of a hill next to the sea. There they found the enormous machine busy separating all the words into letters. The crook had gone to take a nap, so the girls crept up to the machine and started being polite and courteous to each other. Try as it might, the contraption couldn't steal those words, and it started to suffer a power overload, which got more and more serious as the girls went on communicating.

Everything was dark, but between the shadows, the boy could clearly see two eyes watching him intently from above, with a horrific expression on its face. They were big eyes, about a metre apart, giving some idea of the size of that terrible being's head. The boy yelled with every bit of air in his lungs, ran out, and locked the door, leaving the monster in the attic, growling to himself. For the next two days the people in that village were living in terror. The growls from the attic and the beating on the attic door continued, and news of the blighter's cruel nature spread across the land. The disgraceful behaviour only got worse, but no one was brave enough to go up to that attic and confront the beast. Before long, a norwegian fisherman passed by. Some days earlier his whaling ship had sunk, and this fellow seemed like a formidable old sea dog; a hard character indeed. Some men in the village asked him to help them confront the awful creature. The norwegian did not hesitate to help, in return for a little money, but when he approached the attic and heard the growls of the monster, his expression changed and he went downstairs to ask for a lot more money. He also asked for some tools, a big net, and a cart. If he was to triumph against the beast, he wanted to take it away, as a trophy. All the village folk were gathered around, and watched as the norwegian opened the attic door, and went inside, to be met by deep, shuddering growls. After the fisherman had been inside for a short while the noises stopped. Never again would the villagers see the norwegian, or hear the sounds of the beast. Neither did anyone ever dare to go up to the attic again. Do you want to know what happened behind that door? Are you sure? Well, when the norwegian opened the door, he could see the eye of olaf, his enormous and fierce helmsman. The eye was also reflected in a mirror, giving the impression of both belonging to the same head. Olaf's other eye had been covered by a patch for years. Both men continued talking in cries, in their own language, as the whaler told his imprisoned friend that the nervous villagers had given him so much money that they would be able to return and take another ship to carry on fishing. Together they managed to find a way to escape the attic, get to the cart, and disappear forever. And so it was, that fear, and fear alone, impoverished that whole village and enabled the fishermen to recover. And so it happens to this very day.

No one had seen it, and its existence was only known by some remains, and by its highly characteristic call. The call was similar to that of a dog with a toothache: \"Oooh..wa-oooooh!\"Everyone wanted to be the first to photograph and study it. The 'beast' was a nocturnal creature, so during the day the scientists would pass their time studying other matters or in discussion. The most remarkable of them was sir walter tick-fondler. He was a very pleasant and reliable chap, with a tiny little moustache and a huge explorer's hat. Every day, before tea, he would spend an hour sitting at his desk, putting all his equipment and bits and pieces in their proper place. He did this with meticulous precision. The notebook went right at the far edge of the desk, on the right hand side, slightly beyond the recorder, and next to the five pencils which were always in the same order: black, red, blue, green and yellow. The lamp was always towards the end of the desk, next to the camera, on the left… and so it was with all his things, even with the smallest of details. Everyone was amused that this gentleman was such a perfect example of the famous english obsession with order. The researchers spent many nights in that area before the creature appeared, and before it did so some of them even doubted its existence. It appeared suddenly, while everything was quiet. Only a few metres away, the scientists heard its call loud and clear. The famous call of the dog with a toothache. It lasted only an instant, because all the commotion of the researchers scrabbling for their cameras and notebooks scared the creature, and it shot off before it could apparently be seen or studied in any detail. The next morning they all compared their findings. Some had managed to record its call, others had noted down how it moved, and the most fortunate of all had even managed to photograph parts of its tail or legs. They all congratulated each other on what they had got, but when they saw what sir walter had they were shocked. He had taken several complete photos, as well as recording its cry, and making full-colour annotations on the creature! And they were all perfect! They ran to congratulate him as the best researcher of them all. They now understood that his obsession with order had been the best way to prepare himself for working in the dark. This had meant sir walter had no problem in finding and using the recorder, the camera, the notebook and the pencils, all in just fractions of a second and without having to look for them. Of course, the work he did on 'the rarest creature in the world' made sir walter famous. He founded a successful school for researchers and scientists called ioto: 'in order to investigate', and had the honour of naming the animal. And as it had all been such fun and he so enjoyed the field trip, after recording that characteristic call, he didn't hesitate to name the animal the 'whatahoot'.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Never having seen human beings before, the dinosaurs leapt down the mountainside, ready to destroy anything that stood in their way…however, as they approached that little town, the houses were getting bigger and bigger… and when the dinosaurs finally arrived, it turned out that the houses were much bigger than the dinosaurs themselves.

He had tried it at least thirty times, but had always failed. He began the ascent at a good pace, focussing on the snowy summit, imagining the marvellous view and the sense of freedom up there. But as he went on, and his strength dwindled, his gaze would lower, and more often would he look at his worn out boots. Finally, when the clouds had gathered round him, and he understood that he wouldn't be able to enjoy the view from the summit that day, he would sit down to rest, relieved to be able to start the descent back down to the village, though slightly worried about all the jokes he would have to endure. On one of these occasions he went up the mountain accompanied by old peeper, the town optician, who bore witness to the failure. It was peeper who most encouraged bobby to try again, and he presented him with a pair of special sunglasses. \"If it starts clouding over, put these glasses on, or if your feet start hurting put them on too. these are special glasses; they'll help you.\"Bobby accepted the gift without giving it much mind, but when his feet started hurting again he remembered what peeper had said, and he put on the glasses. The pain was pretty bad, but with those new sunglasses he could still manage to see the snow-covered summit; so on he continued. Just as nearly always seemed to happen, misfortune returned in the form of cloud cover. But this time it was so light that he could still see the summit through the clouds. And so bobby kept climbing, leaving the clouds behind, forgetting his pain, and finally arriving at the summit. It was certainly worth it. His feeling of triumph was incomparable; almost as magnificent as that wonderful view, resplendent in its silence, the mountain below surrounded by a dense sea of clouds. Bobby didn't remember the clouds being as thick as that, so he looked more closely at the sunglasses, and understood everything.

Peeper had understood that whenever bobby lost sight of his objective, he would similarly lose sight of his dream, and his will to continue would wane. Bobby realised that the only obstacle to reaching the summit had been his own discouragement. When he could no longer see the top of the mountain, the problems had set in.

Her mother often explained to her that you have to take medicine in the correct amounts, but claire wasn't convinced. One night, she had a very strange dream. In it she was minuscule - smaller than a mosquito - and she was living inside a child. She and many others there were responsible for taking some little red balls to the other end of a big bridge. There, some musicians would collect the balls and turn them into musical notes. They were really happy to do this, because when each little ball reached its destination, the conductor of the orchestra added the new note to the tune, continuing the beautiful music which was delighting them all. Before long, they began to run out of little red balls, and for a while the music lost its power and its joy. The child they were living in was becoming sick. Fortunately, the child soon took some cough medicine and the little red balls started appearing again. Likewise, the music became more powerful and joyful, as it had been before. Suddenly, a loud alarm bell went off. The child had taken too much cough mixture! Just then, hundreds of enormous red balls appeared all at once, and they were so heavy that they could hardly move them. A great chaotic commotion began, and the music stopped once more. Claire, with an enormous effort, finally managed to lift one, and she started to walk the bridge. But it was so heavy that the bridge itself collapsed under her feet. And as she was falling, she heard how the music had stopped forever…clair suddenly woke up, with a fright. Thinking about her dream she understood that taking something so good and so tasty like her cough medicine, was a good thing when it was what was needed, but could be very dangerous if you took too much. From then on, she only wanted to take medicine when she really needed it, and whenever she took it she would say to her mother:    -\"Just the right amount, ok?

Both the patch and the tree gave the place a wonderful appearance, and were the pride and joy of the garden's owner. What no one knew was that the vegetables in the patch and the tree couldn't stand each other. The vegetables hated the tree's shadow, because it left them only just enough light to survive. The tree, on the other hand, resented the vegetables because they drank nearly all the water before it could get to him, leaving him with just enough to survive. The situation became so extreme that the vegetables got totally fed up and decided to use up all the water in the ground so that the tree would dry up. The tree answered back by refusing to shade the vegetables from the hot midday sun, so they too began to dry up. Before long, the vegetables were really scrawny, and the tree's branches were drying up. None of them suspected that the gardener, on seeing his vegetable patch deteriorating, would stop watering it. When he did that, both the tree and the vegetables really learned what thirst was. There seemed to be no solution, but one of the vegetables, a small courgette, understood what was going on, and decided to resolve it. Despite the little water available, and the unforgiving heat, the little courgette did all he could to grow, grow, grow… he managed to grow so big that the gardener started watering the patch again. Now the gardener wanted to enter that beautiful big courgette in some gardening contest. And so it was that the vegetables and the tree realised that it was better to help each other than to fight. They should really learn how to live in harmony with those around them, doing the best they could. So they decided to work together, using both the shade and the water in the best combination to grow good vegetables.

But paca was only a frog. She hadn't been to school and didn't even know that frogs don't have hair, so she thought that her hair would grow if she gave concerts.

While paca was singing, without anyone knowing that there was a frog there, the hairdresser was cutting a customer's hair. A large piece fell onto paca's head, and, seeing herself with so much hair, she thought that her dream was finally coming true. In her excitement, she sang with such strength and enthusiasm that she woke up fredo, the hairdresser's cat. Seeing the pile of moving hair, the cat pounced on it and gobbled it up, mistaking it for a mouse. Paca wasn't saved by her long hair or by her musical style. Being a frog saved her, because fredo didn't like the cold touch and slippery feel of her skin and he spat her out.

After an enormous argument, the boy and the cabbage set off for home, in silence, their anger barely below the surface the whole time. On the way, while crossing the river, the boy slipped and both of them fell into the rapids and were pulled under by the current. With great effort, they managed to come to the surface, grab onto a plank of wood, and stay afloat. They had to spend so much time together, adrift on that plank, that after becoming mightily bored, they ended up conversing. They got to know each other, and became friends. They played many bizarre games, like the fish without a rod, the tiny hiding place, and the king of the mountain. Chatting with his new friend, the boy understood the importance, at his young age, of vegetables like the cabbage, and how wrong it is to always be bad-mouthing them. The cabbage, for his part, realised that sometimes his flavour was a touch strong, and strange to children. So they agreed that when they reached home, the boy would treat the cabbage with great respect, and the cabbage would do its best to taste like spaghetti. Their agreement was nothing if not a great success. The boy's mother was greatly surprised at how willingly he ate the cabbage, and the boy prepared the best hiding place in his tummy for the cabbage, shouting \"Mmm! what great spaghetti!\"\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Almost all of them were playing ball; except monty, who was seen as a bit of a fool - only good for poking fun at. He didn't like fights, or sports, or anything really. He wouldn't even defend himself when they started hitting him! He was so strange, that not even on that day of the outing did he play football with the others. The one time he kicked the ball that day, it ended up over in a little cave. When they went in to get the ball, they found a wooden chest containing an enormous book. The book was giving off a magical shine. The children ran to give the book to the teacher, who was fascinated by it. They all agreed to read it in class in the coming days. The book was called 'the great gifts', and it recounted wonderful tales about great inventors, artists, wise writers, explorers, and treasure hunters. With each story the children became more wide-eyed, and they were enchanted by all those characters with special gifts. They finally reached the last page of the book, which spoke about the origin of those great figures. The teacher read:    -\"There's a place in heaven called the fountain of hearts, where, prior to birth, each heart is assigned its special gifts. they use a little bit of everything to make normal people. but, now and again, something goes wrong, and some hearts end up much emptier than normal. in those cases, the hearts fill up with a last gift which makes the person exceptional. they can lack many other qualities; in many ways they will be different from everyone else, and they may well be seen as strange children. however, when their special gift is discovered, their achievements will become part of books like this one.\"When the teacher closed the book there was a long silence in the classroom. While the children were all thinking about their own gifts, monty came out with one of his bizarre comments:    -\"And if you get a heart transplant, and they give you a pig's heart, will you take on a pig's qualities?\" He asked, in all seriousness. Everyone wanted to burst out laughing, but, looking at monty, they understood that he was exactly one of the special cases, as the book had described. They felt ashamed of every time they had laughed at his clumsiness and funny quirks. From that day forward, never again did they try making fun of monty. Instead, they all worked together to try to help him discover his special gift. His gift turned out to be an incredible artistic talent.

Even though he had many good qualities, he had started to lack respect for others. When his aunt agatha, a big multi-coloured ball of plasticine, gave him a drum for his birthday, he was a nightmare. It didn't matter to him if everyone asked him to play the drum a little quieter, or to go and play somewhere else: thomas went all round the classroom beating his drum, and the fact that he was annoying others didn't affect him in the least. His classmates stopped wanting to play with him. They suffered so much from his noisy drum that even coco wiseman, a very intelligent figure made of lego, invented some special earplugs which allowed you to hear normal sounds, but blocked out the annoying ones. On seeing that the others were ignoring him, and not even being annoyed any more, thomas got very angry with coco wiseman. After a big fight, the inventor ended up falling to the floor all the way from the height of the table. On impact, the blocks he was made of broke up and separated. Even though it was an accident, everyone was angry with thomas. No one wanted anything more to do with him, although that didn't bother him a great deal. Everything would have stayed like that if it hadn't have been for the fact that a few days later, a lovely cuckoo clock was put in the classroom, just next to the shelf thomas slept on. The cuckoo clock was constantly making noise. -\"Tick tock, tick tock,\" And to top it all, every hour the cuckoo came out to do its    -\"Cuckoo cuckoo!\" Thomas couldn't get any rest at all. However, the others, with their special earplugs, were fine. Then thomas started to realise just how much he had annoyed everyone with his drum, and how stupid it had been to fight with coco wiseman. Coco was the only one who would be able to help him now. Determined to rectify the situation, and so everyone would eventually see he was becoming the best-behaved, most respectful boy, he spent all his time reconstructing coco wiseman in secret. He spent many days and nights working on him, and he finally finished the job just when he could hardly have gone on any longer, what with hardly getting any sleep because of the cuckoo clock. When coco was built and came back to life, everyone got a huge surprise, and they enthusiastically congratulated and thanked thomas for all his work. Thomas, in return, asked them to forgive him for his lack of consideration. And so, although coco wiseman was a bit angry at him, thomas managed to convince him to make a pair of earplugs for him too. Finally thomas could get some sleep, and never again was he as inconsiderate as he had been before.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

When he arrived, bobby's wife told him that first he would have to reorganise the cafe so they had a place to put the cow. Bobby was so excited and impatient that he ignored this advice, and took the cow straight to the cafe. The result was quite spectacular. The cow was featured in the newspapers and on tv. Customers came from far and wide to taste the delicious fresh milk coffee. However, after this initial buzz of excitement, it turned out that having a cow in the middle of a cafe was not at all comfortable. Every day the cow broke twenty or thirty cups simply by swishing its tail. The cafe smelt like a stable. The hay the cow ate got spread all over the place, and the cow left so little room in the cafe that there would always be someone getting too close and stepping in a cow pat…and so the cafe began to lose customers. To top it all, the authorities came to do an inspection. They imposed such a heavy fine that bobby almost had to close the place.

Genghis khan was frustrated because of this and in order not to take out his frustration on his companions, genghis khan left the rest of party at camp and rode out alone with his falcon. Genghis khan went out in forest and stayed in forest longer than expected and because of this became tired and thirsty. It was summer time and all streams had dried up and he couldn't find anything to drink there. Just then to his amazement, he saw a thread of water flowing from rocks just in front of him. He removed falcon from his arm and took out a silver cup which he always carried with him. Then slowly he fill it with water, just a he was about to raise it to his lips, falcon flew up and plucked cup from his hands and dashed it on ground. Genghis khan was thirsty, this act of falcon made him furious but still falcon was his favorite so he thought that it might be thirsty that's why did this. He picked up hi cup again, cleaned of dirt and filled it again. When cup was only half filled, falcon attacked again, spilling water. Genghis khan adored his bird but he knew that under any circumstance, he wouldn't allow such disrespect as someone might be watching this scene from afar and later would tell other warriors that great conqueror genghis khan was incapable of taming a mere bird. This time, he drew his sword and then picked up cup again and refilled it, keeping an eye on stream and other on falcon. As soon as he had enough water in cup and was ready to drink, falcon again took flight and flew towards him spilling water, just than with one thrust, genghis khan pierced the bird's breast. Meanwhile, the thread of water had already dried up. Genghis was thirsty and in order to find water, he climbed rock in search of spring from which that thread of water was coming. To his surprise, there was pool of water and in middle of it was lying dead, one of most poisonous snake of that region. At that moment he realized that if he had drink that water, he would have died. Filled with remorse, khan returned to camp with dead falcon in his arms. He ordered a gold figurine of bird to be made, to always remember the lesson from this incident.

Most time of his day would pass studying and praying. His daily routine was to wake up before dawn and then get ready to pray and would study for hours. In evening he would do minimal financial dealings, just enough to earn him basic needs and again study till late at night. His neighbor was a laborer, who would also wake up early in morning and get off to his work. He would struggle to earn his bare living because of which he wouldn't get time to study scripture or get much time to pray. Whenever two neighbors would pass each other in yard, scholar would throw the crass materialist a look of contempt toward his neighbor and then hurry on to his pursuits. Where aspoor laborer would sigh and think to himself, \"How unfortunate of me.. we both wake up early but scholar study for hours while I am off to mundane burdens of daily life, not able to get time even pray properly..\"Time pass and two men concluded their earth's journey and their soul's stood before heavenly court where the life of every man is weighed upon the balance scales of divine judgment. It was scholar turn, an advocate angel placed scholar's many virtues on side of scale which included his many hours of scripture studies, prayers, his frugality and honesty. But then came prosecuting angel, who placed a single object on the other side of the scales - the look of contempt that the scholar would occasionally send his neighbor's way. Slowly, the left side of the scales began to dip until it equaled and then exceeded, the formidable load on the right. Now it was poor laborer turn, his prosecuting angel loaded his miserable, spiritually void life on the left scales. Then advocating angel had but one weight to offer-the sorrowful, covetous sigh the laborer would emit when he encountered his learned neighbor. But when placed on the right side of the scales, the sigh counter weighted everything on the negative side, lifting and validating every moment of hardship and misery in the laborer's life. Deep meaning: regardless of how much scholar learned, it didn't refine him enough to see the good in his laboring neighbor and yet despite the neighbor's spiritual lack, his sigh expressing his deep desire to live a life of a scholar surpassed that.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Months later when rich man returned, he found that all his possessions had gone. He got furious and went to mathematician to ask for explanation. Mathematician calmly told him that he had given away everything to people in need. Rich man couldn't believe it and was getting mad. Mathematician explained rich man his formula, \"I studied for months but every way which I found was always limited as there's limit to how much one man can do by himself. then I understood the key was that many people could help us to achieve the aim. so the conclusion was that helping others was the best way to get more and more people to benefit us.\"Rich man was disappointed and furious over mathematicians act and went out. While he was walking away, several neighbors came to him looking worried about him. All of them were those who were helped by rich man's fortune. They felt grateful to him and offered him to be guest of their houses.

Now, rich man can see the results of what mathematician had calculate. He realized that helping others with some now has given him much, much more. In this way, he managed to quickly set up flourishing businesses, but this time he followed the brilliant mathematician's advice. Now he no longer kept his money in safe, instead he shared out his fortune among people, whose hearts had converted into safest and grateful.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Intrigued, she demanded to see whoever it was who had offered this gift. Despite her curiosity, she pretended to be highly offended by the gift when the young man was brought before her. He explained it to her like this, \"Dear princess, this pebble represents the most valuable thing one can give - it is my heart. it is also sincere, because it is not yet yours, and it is as hard as a stone. only when it fills with love will it soften and be more tender than any other.\"The young man quietly left, leaving the princess surprised and captivated. She fell so in love that she took the little pebble with her wherever she went, and for months she regaled the young man with gifts and attention. But his heart remained as hard as the stone in her hands. Losing hope, she ended up throwing the pebble into a fire.

The class members were a bunch of rather mischievous colours; from black and white, through to red and blue, yellow, and all the rest. They hoped to grow up to be wonderful colours, and this is what they were training for. As well as funny and joyful, the colours were very naughty; particularly black and white, who were so preoccupied with causing mayhem that they were almost always late for class. One morning there was a great commotion in the sky. The clouds were up there, practicing their raining, but they had been raining for so long that they'd gone and created a storm so terrible that absolutely everyone had become saddened and depressed at having so little light. When the sun started shining again, not even that managed to cheer up the world. The only solution was to appeal, as a last resort, to the naughty, mischievous colours, even though they were still very young and weren't yet trained for anything like this. The authorities went straight to their classroom. It was still early, and, as ever, black and white hadn't yet turned up. However, there was no time to lose; they couldn't wait for black and white. The other colours had to do something fast. They ran down the corridors, out of the door, and flew up into the sky, where the clouds - ashamed for what had happened - were waiting. On their way up to the clouds each one of the colours left a resplendent trail. Travelling side by side, the combination of all the colours' trails was so striking and spectacular that smiles returned to everyone's face, and the world filled with the sound of applause. The colours felt honoured and delighted to be named as the sun's official assistants. And the inhabitants of the world begged them to promise that, from that day on, the colours would always be on hand, to help cheer everyone up. It was agreed that whenever the clouds overdid it on the rain, the colours would come quickly and make a rainbow. A bit later, black and white entered the classroom, finding it empty. Everyone was congratulating the other colours so much for their wonderful performance that black and white - really the most fun and happy of all the colours - didn't dare to ask to be part of the rainbow, and from that time onward they forced themselves to be punctual and responsible.

This time the big and famous books hadn't just laughed at them, they had thrown them out. \"You can hardly call yourselves books. you barely have any writing and are just all pictures\", said one book that had lots and lots of pages written in tiny letters. \"We won't let them put you next to us on the library shelf. you're not real books!\", said another, very serious and fancy book. The poor baby books: they were not even allowed a little corner in bookshops or libraries. They ended up piled up in attics and warehouses. The big books were so happy. Only intelligent people and adults came into bookshops now given that there was nothing interesting for naughty children. The children stayed at the entrance, so the books were no longer scared that they would be manhandled or that their pages would be torn out and dirtied. Years passed and all those children who hadn't visited a library became adults. \"Now they can come in and meet us and admire our wisdom\", thought the big books. But no. The adults who had grown up without baby books had no interest in the big books. They were too long! How were they going to read so many pages all at once, if they had never read anything? The big books were desperate. Bookshops were closing down, libraries looked derelict. Nobody was reading! They all arranged a meeting, they read and read millions of their own pages and discovered that there was only one solution: they had to say sorry to the baby books and get them to come back and put them on the best shelves. That's how they managed to save themselves, by making children read little by little, so that they would grow up to be adults who loved big books. And so that nobody would forget what almost happened, they wrote the story in this baby book, which they give to everybody who thinks that books with few words and loads of pictures aren't real books.

The rich man wanted the mathematician to find the best way for him to make the greatest profit in everything he did. The rich man was building a huge safe, and his greatest dream was to fill it with gold and jewels. The mathematician was shut away for months in his study, before finally believing he had found the solution. But he soon found there were some errors in his calculations, and he started all over again. One night he appeared at the rich man's house, with a big smile on his face: \"I found it!\" He said, \"My calculations are perfect.\" The rich man was going on a long journey the next day, and didn't have time to listen. He promised the mathematician he would pay him double his wages if he would take charge of the business while he was away, and put the new formulas into practice. Excited by his new discovery, the mathematician was delighted to accept. When the rich man returned, months later, he found that all of his possessions had gone. Furious, he went to ask for an explanation from the mathematician. The mathematician calmly told him what he had done. He had given everything away to people. The rich man couldn't believe it, but the mathematician explained it further. \"For months I analysed how a rich man could gain the maximum benefit, but what I could do was always limited. there's a limit to how much one man can do by himself. then I understood the key was that many people could help us to achieve the aim. so the conclusion was that helping others was the best way to get more and more people to benefit us.\"Disappointed and furious, the greedy man stormed off, desperate at having lost everything to the hare-brained schemes of a madman. However, while he was walking away disconsolately, several neighbours ran over, worried about him. All of them had been helped when the mathematician shared out the rich man's fortune. They felt so grateful to him that they offered him the hospitality of their houses, and anything such a special man might need. The neighbours even argued over who would get to help him. Over the next few days, he saw the full results of what the mathematician had calculated. Wherever he went he was received with great honour, and everyone was willing to help him in whatever way they could. He realised that his not having anything had given him much, much more. In this way, he managed to quickly set up flourishing businesses, but this time he followed the brilliant mathematician's advice. No longer did he keep his riches in a safe, or anything like it. Instead, he shared out his fortune among a hundred friends, whose hearts he had converted into the safest, most grateful and fruitful of safes.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

No one expected her; she was still young and, what's more, she was the mother of two small children. Saint peter looked at her, very seriously. \"And what are you doing here? surely it's not your time yet\". Even so, after checking the ledger, he indeed found her name, but still found it hard to believe. It was true. She had done all the things that allow one to enter into heaven, including leaving her children with everything they would need, and she had managed it all in so little time! On seeing his surprise, tatiana smiled and said,\"I've always done things quickly. ever since adrian and andrea were babies I gave them everything I had, and I kept it in the form of a treasure which only they could access\". Everyone in heaven knew what tatiana was referring to. From day one mothers set to work, filling the hearts of their children with love and virtues. And the rule is that mothers can only go to heaven once they have completely filled their children's hearts. This was amazing news. It was very unusual to hear of children having their hearts filled so soon, and everyone in heaven wanted to investigate. Looking at children's hearts is the favourite pastime of the angels. At night, when children are sleeping, their hearts shine intensely with a purplish light that only angels can see. The angels certainly come to see; they sit around the children, softly singing songs of beauty. And so it was that, that night, in the bedroom of adrian and andrea, thousands of angels gathered. Neither of the children had overcome their grief at their mother's passing, but they were managing to sleep. On falling asleep, their hearts started to light up, as always. Gradually the light became more intense until their hearts shone brilliantly and with unmatched beauty. Without any doubt, tatiana had left their hearts brimming with such love and such virtue that they could have shared these with thousands of other children. The angels gave thanks for a spectacle of such beauty, they sang hymns of praise, and resolved to return each night. On waking, neither adrian nor andrea noticed anything strange, but they did feel filled with a strength to meet the new the day with enthusiasm; ready to grow and learn in the way their mother had always wanted. So, without ever failing to miss their mother, adrian and andrea developed into a pair of wonderful children, overflowing with goodness. Every day they took inspiration from hearts filled with love and virtue, left to them by their mother, and from the nightly presence of thousands of angels who came to see them shine.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

The turtle was frightened and withdrew into its shell. When the rhino demanded that the turtle get out of his territory, there was no discernible movement. The rhino was incredibly annoyed; he thought the turtle was fooling him. So he started banging the shell to make the turtle come out. No success, and his blows got increasingly violent. He whacked it with his horn, sending the poor turtle flying in all directions. From a distance, it looked a bit like a solitary game of football, with the turtle as the ball. Quite an amusing spectacle, it was, and a load of monkeys soon gathered close by to enjoy it. They laughed non-stop at the angry rhino and his struggle with the turtle. The rhino was so furious that he didn't even notice that they were there. On he went, until he had to stop for a second to get his breath. Now that he wasn't bashing the shell, he could hear the laughing and joking of the monkeys, who were making fun of him in every way you can imagine. Neither the rhino, nor the turtle - who had appeared from his shell -, enjoyed the fact that a gang of monkeys was mocking them. So, they exchanged a knowing look, nodded, and the turtle went back inside his shell.

In truth, zepo rete had always been bad, but he was also stupid and when he realised that books made people smarter he decided to put them in a blender and drink them, thinking that it would make him cleverer.

He used hundreds of soaps and bleaches to try and wash off the words before he realised that the only way to remove them was by reading them.

So, with a complex system of cameras and tubes, the doctor managed to record what was happening inside the boy. What he discovered was surprising.

That explained the boy's happiness, but the doctor continued studying until he discovered that we all have our own thousand angels inside us. Unfortunately, he found that, as we do so few good things, the angels spend most of their time wandering about, bored. And so it was that the secret to happiness was discovered.

He could hardly sleep at night and, lying on a branch of his magnificent tree, he spent his time watching what was happening in the forest at night. This is how he came to learn that there was a thief in that forest. He would watch the thief go out every night with empty hands and return loaded up with his stolen loot. Sometimes the thief had nabbed the senior monkey's bananas, other times he had filched the lion's wig, or pinched the zebra's stripes. One night he even snuck home with the big elephant's false tusk, which the elephant had been secretly wearing for quite some time. However, as the leopard was a very quiet sort of cat, who lived at the margin of everything, he didn't want to say anything to anyone. He didn't see it as his business, and, if truth were told, he rather enjoyed discovering these little secrets. And so, thanks to the stealthy thief, quite a stir was being created in the world of the animals: the elephant felt ridiculous without his false tusk, and the zebra now looked like a white donkey, not to mention the lion who, now as bald as a lioness had lost all respect. Most of the other animals were in some similar position too. They were furious, confused or ridiculous, but the leopard lay quietly in his tree, each night enjoying the thief's escapades. However, one night the thief went on vacation, and after having waited a long while for him to appear, the leopard grew tired and decided to sleep for a while. When he woke up he found himself in a place very different from his usual tree, he was floating on the water of a small lake inside a cave, and around him he could see all those objects which, night after night, he had seen being stolen… the thief had cut down his tree and stolen his entire home along with the leopard himself! Well this was the last straw, so the leopard, taking advantage of the thief not being there, ran out and went straight to see the other animals to tell them where the thief had hidden all their things… they all praised the leopard for having discovered the thief and his hideout, and allowing them to recover their possessions. In the end, the animal who lost most from all this was the leopard, who couldn't replant his magnificent tree and had to make do with a much inferior tree located in a very boring site… and he regretted having not been concerned at the problems of the other animals, now seeing that in the long run those very problems had become his own.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

He would jump to the ground from amazing heights, he would fight poisonous snakes, he would catch scorpions with his bare hands, and could cut the palm of his own hand with a knife - without even a flinch. They said the exact opposite about pontoma. No one had seen him catch even a monkey. One day, they happened upon each other in the forest, and manute was showing pontoma a coral snake he had just caught, when there began a downpour, the likes of which no one had ever seen. They both ran to shelter themselves under some thick foliage, and there they stayed until the rain had stopped. However, when they were about to leave the shelter, they heard the roar of a tiger, at a distance of only a couple of meters. The foliage was very thick and dense, and the tiger wouldn't be able to get through it to attack them. However, the tiger was almost at the entrance hole. If it happened to come in and find the two tribesmen there, they certainly wouldn't get out alive. Manute was getting restless. He wanted to get out of that tight hole, and confront the tiger in open space, where he could fully use his great hunting skills. Pontoma was gesturing at him to keep still and be quiet, but manute, tired of being stuck with a coward, leapt out of the thicket, surprising the tiger. The tiger suffered a couple of deep wounds, but soon recovered, and hurt manute with two swipes of its paw, throwing him to the ground. The tiger took the initiative, and leapt upon manute, but manute's spear, in the hands of pontoma, interrupted the tiger's attack. The tiger turned away, wounded, but the spear moved as fast as a beam of light, and with incredible precision, hurting the animal again and again, until it fell to the ground, lifeless. Manute, shocked, and bleeding freely from his injuries, witnessed all this while lying flat on his back on the ground. Never before had he seen anyone take on a tiger, and use the spear with such calmness and strength, as he had seen pontoma do just now. Neither of them said a thing. Manute's grateful expression needed no words to be understood. Nor did they need words to know about pontoma's wounded hand, or the fact that they were leaving a tiger skin there in the forest. From that day on, people gradually remarked less on manute's braveness. They thought maybe he was less courageous than before. The strangest thing was that they now noticed that manute's old spear was among pontoma's things.

More than once he got angry with some silly atocinaut who wouldn't stop making fun of him, without the atocinaut seeming to realise that tom wasn't fortunate enough to possess a functioning hypersensory lettuce on his head. Then, one day, just like they had taken him away, the atocinauts brought tom back to earth again, and everything continued as if nothing had ever happened. Tom didn't dare tell anyone about his voyage, and no one suspected anything. No one, that is, except clara - a blind classmate of tom's, who noticed that he began to treat her with more attention and sensitivity. It was as though tom knew just how she most wanted to be treated. And when she asked him how come he had changed, tom answered mysteriously and tantalisingly: \"I changed because you don't have a lettuce on your head, and now I know exactly how that feels.\"\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Everyone, that is, except pionina herself, who will shake her head and silently think about her sister fiorina. No one has yet seen her, but fiorina was clearly the most beautiful of the two fairy sisters. Both were born from the same big, perfect, dewdrop, and for years they spent their lives together inside the same flower. The problem was that they were so shy that they never wanted to go out into the world. As they didn't know any other fairies, they wondered whether they themselves were beautiful or ugly, intelligent or stupid, fortunate or unlucky. They thought about this so much and so often that they ended up convinced that they were ugly, stupid and unlucky. So much so, that they resolved never to leave their comfortable flower. There they stayed, living their lives regretting their misfortune. How could they show themselves to the world, when they were such a pair of disasters? What would others say about them? And what if others rejected them and ridiculed them? That was, until one day when pionina summoned up enough courage to leave the flower. -\"It's not my fault I'm so horrible,\" She told herself, -\"I will try to be kind and cheerful, and maybe that way they will forgive me my flaws,\" She thought, now determined to venture out. Pionina tried everything to get her sister to go with her, but fiorina didn't feel capable of overcoming her shyness. Even though she was really dying to leave the flower, she decided to stay…when pionina leapt out, and began her acrobatic flight across the land, a special gleaming light enveloped the whole countryside. Seeing this light, hundreds of fairies emerged from their flowers to take it all in. They all watched in admiration as they beheld the most beautiful fairy anyone had ever seen. Before long, there was a huge commotion all around pionina, and in only a few short minutes she had become the most famous of all fairies, thanks to her beauty, her intelligence, and her good fortune. Pionina then hurried off to tell her sister how mistaken they had been for all those years. The problem was, she didn't know the way back to her flower. In that land there were hundreds of thousands of flowers, just like her own. Pionina couldn't tell which one was the one she had lived in. She searched and searched, but could never manage to find fiorina. And there fiorina remained, hidden in her flower, filled with fear, believing herself to be the most horrible of fairies; never knowing that if she ever decided to come out, she would realise that she was the most beautiful and fortunate of all the fairies.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

From such an unlikely confluence of events there could only emerge a new superhero, with impressive superpowers: superpower ultra man! Such were his powers that he immediately thought he should not waste them on little things, and superpower ultra man began hunting danger and threats to the world, so he could save us from the worst of the worst. But the more he searched with his super-sight, the more he travelled the world with his hyper-velocity, and listened to the skies with his multi-frequency digital hearing, he found no one trying to conquer the galaxy or attempting to blow up the planet. He couldn't even find some villain planning to drain the seas or plunder a mountain. It seemed as thought everyone, the good and the bad, were busy with much more mundane things, and they only had normal problems. So superpower ultra man spent his days bored, exploring the skies in search of missions impossible that were deserving of a superhero of his calibre. He got so very bored that when they offered him a television program to do, to demonstrate his abilities, he accepted, though he would only get the chance to rescue a few dozen people.

Superpower ultra man was so used to thinking of things on a grand scale that he didn't know how to grab and rescue a single person.

But when these bits of litter came to life something awful happened: around every paper plate and every empty tin, the forest turned grey, and this greyness started quickly spreading everywhere: to the grass, to the flowers, to the animals… the boy realised the litter was to blame for all the greyness, so he ran through the forest with the blackboard rubber in his hand to rub them out wherever they had landed. He was lucky. He was quick, and didn't leave a single piece of litter. The forest and its animals managed to recover, and they played together for the rest of the day.

Even so, the idea of spending his life robbing people certainly didn't appeal to young longhands.

As time went on, it became obvious to everyone that longhands wasn't a pirate; but the family tradition was so long and so wonderfully infamous that no one was bold enough to come out and say it. \"It's just that he's a good pirate,\" They would say.

This didn't leave him enough time to follow his own dreams of greatness. He was always busy looking for ways to more effectively help others.

But the second young man was so used to solving all kinds of problems, and had such useful know-how in certain subjects, that the disaster hardly affected the people in his region at all. His admirable methods were then adopted across the land, and the fame of this good and wise man spread even more than had that of the first young man.

The effects of this spell varied according to the disease, but they usually took the form of small magical misfortunes, such as becoming suddenly bald, sneezing out ice cubes, crying out of your feet, or having such sticky hands that it was impossible to let go of anything you'd picked up. It being the case that not everyone touches others with the same frequency, it so happened that some people passed on the magic illness very easily, but others - those with less contact with people - became really seriously ill, particularly when they'd spent more than three days with the virus. Of course, no-one thought these small misfortunes were caused by a virus, and the blame was usually pinned on some mischievous elf or passing witch. Only one doctor from that area - dr. Ivor malady - , began suspecting something, after having contracted the illness over twenty times himself, and almost always after doing his rounds. He began experimenting on his patients and on himself, and within a few days he was certain about how the disease was transmitted. The good doctor called all the townsfolk to a meeting and told them that their illness would last for as long as it took them to touch someone else. And so it was that the town became the world chasing capital. Residents spent much of their time chasing others around the streets, to touch their chosen victim, in order to get rid of the virus. Even the oldest folk joined in the fun, and the people's health improved so much with all the running about that dr. Malady was presented with many prizes and awards. The funniest thing is that the magi-virus moved towns without anyone realising it. It was taken away by a man who came to visit, and bumped into a \"Carrier\" Who was sprinting after some children. On returning to his home town, things were a bit different, and instead of chase, that town became world hugging capital. Everyone who passed that way was given a great big bear hug, along with the magic illness. So it didn't take long for the virus to move on to another town, and in this third town the people ended up spending all hours of the day kissing each other. And so it was, one after another, the magi-virus went around the world, changing people's behaviour wherever it went, making every place more fun and more friendly, leaving everyone feeling closer. Such is the effect that no-one minds whether the virus has remained there or moved on, because all are enchanted by the changes it brings.\nWhich moral is this story attempting to convey?

Unfortunately, he had little money and couldn't afford one. One day, at the side of a path, he found a box for one of his favourite kinds of rocket. Opening it, he found there was only one rocket inside, made of dodgy paper, the consequence of a factory malfunction. The boy was very disappointed, but at least he now finally had a rocket of sorts. He started preparing his plans for the launch. For many days he collected paper of all shapes, sizes and colours; and with all his soul he set about drawing, painting, cutting, sticking, and colouring all the stars and planets that would turn his rocket into an outer space in paper form. It wasn't an easy job, but the final result was so magnificent that his bedroom wall looked like an open window onto the galaxy. From then on, the boy enjoyed playing with his paper rocket every day. One day, a friend came to visit, and in the boy's bedroom he saw that spectacular sight. The friend offered to swap it with the boy, for a real rocket he had at home. The boy went almost mad with joy, and delightedly accepted the swap. Since then, each day, playing with his new rocket, the boy would miss more and more his old paper rocket, with its planets, stars and all the rest. Really, he had much preferred playing with that one. He realised that it was much more fun playing with toys he had made himself, with great effort and enthusiasm.

Each night he would say me that, \"I am going to work. you can rest and pray.\" When he came back I would ask him, \"Did you get anything today?\" He would reply, \"No not tonight but tomorrow I will try again. god willing.\"Even after daily disappointment he never lost hope and he was always happy.

I asked him, \"Have you lit this candle yourself? \" He replied, \"Yes sir.\" I said, \"There was time when candle was not lit and when it was lit but can you show me the source from which light came?\" Boy laughed and blew out the candle and said ,\"You have seen light go? can you tell me where it had gone?? \" Boy continued, \"Ok, I will tell you it had gone to the same place where it emerged. it had returned to the source.\"This shattered my ego and at that moment I felt how stupid I was.

He gave ample assurance that he would prove to be more efficient and capable than birbal. Before akbar could take a decision on this matter, this news reached birbal. Birbal resigned and left. Akbar's brother in law was made the minister in place of birbal. Akbar decided to test the new minister. He gave three hundred gold coins to him and said, \"Spend these gold coins such that, I get a hundred gold coins here in this life; a hundred gold coins in the other world and another hundred gold coins neither here nor there.\"The minister found the entire situation to be a maze of confusion and hopelessness. He spent sleepless nights worrying how he would get himself out of this mess. Thinking in circles was making him go crazy. Eventually, on the advice of his wife, he sought birbals help. Birbal said, \"Just give me the gold coins. I shall handle the rest.\" Birbal walked the streets of the city holding the bag of gold coins in his hand. He noticed a rich merchant celebrating his son's wedding. Birbal gave a hundred gold coins to him and bowed courteously saying, \"Emperor akbar sends you his good wishes and blessings for the wedding of your son. please accept the gift he has sent.\" The merchant felt honored that the king had sent a special messenger with such a precious gift. He honored birbal and gave him a large number of expensive gifts and a bag of gold coins as a return gift for the king. Next, birbal went to the area of the city where the poor people lived. There he bought food and clothing in exchange for a hundred gold coins and distributed them in the name of the emperor. When he came back to town he organized a concert of music and dance. He spent a hundred gold coins on it. The next day birbal entered akbar's darbar and announced that he had done all that the king had asked his brother-in-law to do. The emperor wanted to know how he had done it. Birbal repeated the sequences of all the events and then said, \"The money I gave to the merchant for the wedding of his son - you have got back while on this earth. the money I spent on buying food and clothing for the poor - you will get it in the other world. the money I spent on the musical concert - you will get neither here nor there.\" Akbar's brother in law understood his mistake and resigned.

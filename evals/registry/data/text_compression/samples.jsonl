When one of the companies relocated in the 1990s, however, the bulky walkway was abandoned.\nFortunately, the sky bridge has now been revitalized with a permanent installation by the California designer known for his extravagant, light-based, and Coachella-esque works of art.

This means that the sort is case insensitive and number sequences are sorted by value rather than lexicographically.\nTemplate handling need not depend on Data System APIs, should be available for clients that only know FileSystems. Relevant interfaces moved to openide.filesystems.templates module; see javadoc for FileBuilder for details.\nJan 29 '14 Introduce targetName for templates.\nBy default, files created from templates have name preinitialized to \"new\" + template name. TemplateRegistration.targetName can be used to customize how the file name will be preinitialized.\nOct 10 '13 Introduces SortMode for sorting by file extension.\nIt's possible to sort files using sort mode \"By Type\", which means using SortMode.CLASS. It may be confusing, as users expect that the files will be sorted by file type, i.e. by extension. \"By Type\" was renamed to \"By Class\" and new sort mode \"By Extension\" (SortMode.EXTENSIONS) was added.\nOften many people require ability to create a \"clever\" template - e.g. write piece of simple text and at the time of its processing do some advanced changes to it using either scripting or templating languages.\nThis traditionally used to be a bit complicated task, however since version 6.1 there are new interfaces can be registered as a services in a lookup and it is reponsible for handling the whole copy of the template file(s) to the destination folder. and can be registered as a services in a lookup and it is reponsible for providing \"hints\" - e.g. map mapping strings to various objects. and these interfaces allow anyone to extend the behaviour during creation of new files without writing new DataLoader and co.\nThe support was moved to a new module; please see api.templates module for more information.\nHow to add action to folder's popup menu?\nAs described in general actions registration tutorial.\nThis functionality is available since version 5.0 of the loaders module. Please use OpenIDE-Module-Module-Dependencies: org.openide.loaders > 5.0 in your module dependencies.\nHow to allow others to enhance actions of your loader?\nIf you want other modules to enhance or modify actions that are visible on DataObjects produced by your DataLoader and you are either using DataNode or its subclass, you can just override protected String actionsContext() method to return non-null location of context in layers from where to read the actions.\nThe usual value should match Loaders/mime/type/Actions scheme, for example java is using Loaders/text/x-java/Actions, but the name can be arbitrary.\ncan be registered as a services in a lookup and it is reponsible for handling the whole copy of the template file(s) to the destination folder.\ncan be registered as a services in a lookup and it is reponsible for providing \"hints\" - e.g. map mapping strings to various objects.\nThe actions that the default folder loader shows in its popup menu are read from a layer folder Loaders/folder/any/Actions so if any module wishes to extend, hide or reorder some of them it can just register its actions there.\nLoaders are registered in the layer in folder Loaders/mime/type/Factories.\nA folder Privileged offers to other module possibility add own templates.\nA folder Recent stores a set of recently used templates, it's not open to other module.\nThe main menu of the application is composed by reading Menu/ folder in the layer. A sub folder is treated as a sub menu. Instances of individual files (usually .instance or .shadow) may then represent Action or JMenuItem or JSeparator.\nSince version 7.44 one can attach property-prefix attribute to every folder. Then all the file attributes are scanned and if some of them start with the specified prefix they are placed a client properties on the JMenu instance (after stripping the prefix off).\nExtended attribute for holding the class of the loader that should be used to recognize a file object before the normal processing takes place.\nExtended attribute which may be used in addition to EA_ASSIGNED_LOADER which indicates the code name base of the module that installed that preferred loader. If the indicated module is not installed, ignore the loader request. See #13816.\nIf set to Boolean.TRUE the file is recognized as template and its instantiation is allowed.\nIf the file attribute isRemoteAndSlow is true on a folder, the New File wizard will avoid asking for its children.\nAttribute that defines a template wizard description page (type URL to HTML).\nAttribute that defines a custom template wizard iterator (type TemplateWizard.Iterator).\nPath to the target file in its filesystem (type String).\nSystem name of filesystem of target file (type String; default is same as that of shadow).\ntemplates and folders under Templates/ folder can be annotated with <attr name=\"simple\" boolvalue=\"false\"< if they are supposed to be hidden in Template Manager. If a folder is annotated with this attribute, it is also hidden in standard New File wizard.\nRead the list of intended partial orders from disk. Each element is a string of the form a/b for a, b filenames with extension, where a should come before b. The value of the attribute must be of type Boolean; ignored unless true.\nExtended attribute for order of children. The values are \"F\", \"N\", \"C\", \"0\" (type String).\nExtended attribute for order of children - stores list of file names separated by '/' (type String).\nExtended attribute to store (ArrayList of Type and Node.Handle). Used by Java synchronization feature at least; generally, ConnectionCookie.\nIf set to Boolean.TRUE on a folder not in the system filesystem, make its node reorderable.\nWhen TemplateWizard invokes DataObject.createFromTemplate, it passes as argument all its properties to it with prefix wizard.. That way they are available to underlaying scripting and templating engines.\nDataObject - created on the fly, very inefficient, if requested from AWT dispatch thread, it prints a warning. Consider using just FileObject.\nThe creation of real node is scheduled to background and as soon as the DataObject and its Node are ready, the initial dummy node is replaced by the real one.\nThis whole system is slightly incompatible and may complicate creation of filtered views over the node hierarchy (one needs to be ready to really dynamics changes). That is why it is possible to disable the new delayed system by starting the system with -Dorg.openide.loaders.FolderChildren.delayedCreation=false. Use this property as a temporary fix for your problems, but consider fixing your code to support the delayed mode in the future.\nThe value of type integer determines the number of milliseconds between successive refreshes of contents of a folder. Can be used to tweak performance of folder refresh. Defaults to 10.\nIf set to true, the DataObject.copy, move, createFromTemplate are executed in insecure way. That means that other threads can access the products of such operation before it finishes. This is a friend contract with projects, that need to do such strange things.

{"text": "They have won elections, and they support our mission. Meet the elected officials on our side.\n\u201cEver since its inception in the mid-19th century, Republicans at the local, state and national levels have been leaders in critically important conservation efforts and in creating our system for monitoring and improving our environment. For example, Washington state\u2019s environment has been protected and pristine forests conserved by the leadership of Republicans throughout the years. Governor Dan Evans (1965-1977) successfully championed the creation of the Department of Ecology, the passage of the Shoreline Management Act, the largest number of clean water and clean air bond issues in the history of the state and much more. Governor John Spellman (1981-1985) protected Puget Sound by courageously vetoing a measure that would have allowed the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company to construct huge offshore oil rigs at Cherry Point. U. S. Senator Slade Gorton, Congressman Sid Morrison and Congressman Dave Reichert were successful in getting large areas of our forest land preserved for future generations. This is our proud Republican legacy in our state. Most importantly. the American Conservation Council is an appropriate and needed outgrowth of this legacy.\"\n\"It is with great enthusiasm that I formally endorse the American Conservation Coalition. In a time in which so much divisiveness has struck environmental discussions, the ACC seeks to reach across the political divide by providing a forum for conservatives who cherish the environment, as well as free market reforms. As a lifelong congressional advocate for Great Lakes restoration projects, a less intrusive EPA, and conservative environmental reforms, I am thrilled to see the ACC launch. The ACC is the United States' ticket to bridging the gap and inviting conservatives to the fold on environmental discussions. I look forward to seeing what they can accomplish.\"\nWhen I was growing up, Republicans owned the environmental agenda. Republicans worked to clean our air and water, protect our shorelines and unique places of natural beauty. Conservation and stewardship were understood to be entirely consistent with conservative principles. I have long awaited a pro-environmental conservative organization like the American Conservation Coalition to burst on to the scene and help us reclaim the environmental agenda. With environmental issues at the top of most young Americans' minds, it is imperative that conservatives lead with common sense, market and technologically driven reforms, programs and protections\"\n\"If there ever were a time to increase environmental advocacy, that time is now! If there were ever any hope whatsoever that conservative republicans could remember their history and purpose as it relates to the environment, there is only one entity that can remind them: The American Conservation Coalition. They have the intellect, passion and strategic vision for success, and my vote of confidence!\"\n\"In my 30 years of political activism and leadership, I've never seen the levels of rancor and divisiveness that we're seeing today around the country. To win two statewide elections for Attorney General as a Republican in a blue state, I had to build coalitions with Democrats and Independents, and that would be much harder to accomplish today.\nI strongly support the American Conservation Coalition because its conservative approach to conservation, emphasizing market solutions to pressing environmental problems, is both pragmatic and effective. I also support ACC and its exciting, next-generation leadership because they are strongly committed to building partnerships that will unite Americans to find solutions that we can all support.\"\n\"I'm excited to see young conservatives taking on the issue of the environment and establishing that conservatives can--and do--care.\"\nPlease note that endorsements featured here do not necessarily represent the support of their employers.", "type": "c4", "length": "3977", "entropy": "4.407995555593384", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.46571213262999245", "brevity_score": "0.0028490028490028596"}

{"text": "According to the fiscal year (FY) 2019 Final Rule, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will enforce the longstanding requirement of completing a CMS approved home office cost statement in the 287-05 format. CMS will reject entire cost reports for providers that bring in cost(s) from chain components, or related parties, in a nonapproved format (hospital, skilled nursing facility, home health aide, hospice). When and if a cost report is rejected, the Medicare payments will be put on hold and interest charged for any payments due. Once an acceptable cost report is submitted, it can take up to 30 days for the payments to be released. This new requirement will be enforced for all cost reports beginning on or after Oct. 1, 2018.\nA chain organization consists of a group of two or more healthcare facilities which are owned, leased, or through any other device, controlled by one organization (Provider Reimbursement Manual 1 (PRM-1), CMS Pub. 15-1, Chapter 21, Section 2150). When a provider claims costs on its cost report that are allocated from a home office (also known as a chain home office or chain organization), the Home Office Cost Statement constitutes the documentary support required of the provider to be reimbursed for home office costs in the provider\u2019s cost report as set forth in Section 2153, Chapter 21, of the PRM-1. Section 2153 states that each contractor servicing a provider in a chain must be furnished with a detailed Home Office Cost Statement as a basis for reimbursing the provider for cost allocations from a home office or chain organization. However, many cost reports that have home office costs allocated to them are submitted without a Home Office Cost Statement as a supporting document. In addition, there are home offices or chain organizations that are not completing a Home Office Cost Statement to support the costs they are allocating to the provider cost reports. Lack of this documentation should result in a disallowance of costs. It is our understanding that some providers paid under a PPS mistakenly believe that a Home Office Cost Statement is no longer required. However, the home office costs reported in the provider\u2019s cost report may have an impact on future rate-setting and payment refinement activities. We stated in the FY 2019 IPPS/LTCH PPS proposed rule (83 FR 20748) that we believe that requiring a home office or chain organization to complete a Home Office Cost Statement and a provider to submit, with its cost report, a copy of the Home Office Cost Statement completed by the home office or chain organization that corresponds to the amounts allocated from the home office or chain organization to the provider\u2019s cost report, is consistent with Section 2153 of the PRM-1 and would be consistent with a provider\u2019s recordkeeping and cost reporting requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 413.20 and 413.24, which require a provider to substantiate its costs.\nFor questions, contact Amanda Springborn, manager, RSM health care advisory services, at + 1 314 925 3838.", "type": "c4", "length": "3028", "entropy": "4.5034102097258915", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4216589861751152", "brevity_score": "0.004132231404958693"}

{"text": "Triage: Observe combined with Triage: Diagnose gives you a full incident data collection and analysis solution which will aid your support process in the isolation of incidents and ultimately improving the Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) for your support incidents.\nThe normal support process for any given registered support case can be difficult. Performing initial triage can be either time consuming or error prone. Triage from AXImprove structures the incident and collects technical and functional data appropriate to the incident.\nThe key point is; it is the user who initially observes the incident occurring. The user is the person best placed to describe the incident but often they are unable to provide all the information needed for the support process first time round. It can be difficult to replicate and more importantly to isolate so that the support process can then determine resolution steps for the incident.\nThe whole process of liaising between users and support personnel is fraught with inefficiencies. Often level 2 and level 3 support personnel will get involved where they do not need to, and there will be rounds of communication between the user and support, clarifying points, while support try to replicate and isolate the incident.\nTriage assists the whole process by letting the user utilise the system to document everything required to make initial triage possible. Every user interaction is recorded both from the functional and technical aspect. In short, a document is created describing what the user did in the system thereby giving full user context to the incident, additionally the full execution path is recorded giving support a unique view from a system perspective on what interactions the user performed with the system.\n1) How was the user interacting with the system and what data did they use when they recreated the incident?\n2) What code was executed by the system?\n3) Where does that code reside? i.e. Who does the code belong to?\nAnswers to these questions allow the incident to be scheduled to the most appropriate resources: a consultant when a system issue is detected, a developer or third-party in case of custom code.\nYou can also observe what has happened and what code has been executed; the section above with a grey background has been modified in usr layer, the blue code execution trail also turns red when stepping on usr layer code.\nTriage will quickly categorise the incidents as belonging to Standard AX, an AX add-on, or a customer specific development, both reducing the time spent on the support call and ensuring optimum use of resources.\nTriage will reveal the modules used, the layers, objects and code customisations down to line-by-line level resolution. This allows the best resource to be scheduled to investigate further. Having total visibility on the lines of code used, a developer can recognise the conditions, (just by looking at the branches of code visited) and instantly decide where to place the checkpoints, saving potentially hours of investigation.\nDoes not require the use of AX's standard 'Trace' which is too complicated for the average user.\nRefer to the specific Triage: Observe and Triage: Diagnose pages for further information.", "type": "c4", "length": "3230", "entropy": "4.329448532963822", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4473684210526316", "brevity_score": "0.0035714285714285583"}

Foods rich in calcium are more advisable.\nChildren should take lots of milk and avoid sugary foods as they lead to decay of teeth especially if the sugars are not got rid of, make it their routine to brush teeth before they go to bed, a regular checkup is also advisable as they will grow to adapt the strategy in their families.\nA good breathe will facilitate how people you are speaking to react towards you, for example, you are a sales person, and you approach someone, eager to make a sale, your breathe isn't so pleasant, for sure the person if they don't have the courage to tell you, will walk away from you and your sales for the day may not reach the desired target.\nA clean mouth accompanied by regular dental visits will keep your teeth and gums healthy, bacteria find it hard to survive in a clean environment and so they will not thrive in your mouth hence preventing bacterial related infections to your mouth.\nRegular dental visits enable the dentists check for cavities and they are treated In time and also check for plagues that often lead to tartar on the teeth if not taken care of early. They also check the gums, tongue, head, neck and throat for any signs of swelling or any sign for a disease.\nA healthy mouth prevents risk of serious health ailments, since most diseases first manifest themselves through the mouth; hence good oral hygiene prevents risk of such diseases and conditions as: heart attack, stroke, poorly controlled diabetes and preterm labor.\nProper dental care facilitates retention of teeth and hence you still have your dental formula as you grow old. It's everyone's wish that they grow old with their teeth intact, well here is where to begin; dental care is the main key.\nVarious persons have specialized in dental care Calgary se so as to facilitate the proper health of everyone's teeth, they include; General dentists, Endodontist, Oral and maxillofacial radiologist, Oral pathologist, Oral and Maxillofacial surgeon, Orthodontist, Pediatric dentist, periodontist just to mention a few.\nThese is just to show you how important your dental health is, take care of it and don't let it reach a place where a surgery has to be performed on you, however there circumstances we cannot avoid, so if it happens, remember Friends and Family Dental Health SE-Calgary offers all these services, check in for help.\nWe hope you will join our team by becoming a member.\nThe heading Newsletter is updated.\n\"Access to respite care and leisure for children with special needs\"\nAs part of the 36th Annual Meeting of the Child Neurology Society, a panel discussion hosted by the Cerebral Palsy Consortium will take place October 13, 2007 from 1:30 to 3:30 pm.

{"text": "With my Program II, I aim to explore the phenomenon of child development. To condense my major into a question, I am essentially asking, \"What causes children to grow into the adults they eventually become?\" When selecting courses, I delineated this almost infinite topic into three main arms of investigation - biologic, individual, and systemic influences. Over my four years at Duke, I have had the opportunity to study everything from genetics to biopsychosocial theory, and from metabolic systems to health and education policy. The series of interactions among all these systems is endlessly complex. But their net sum is the reality of human life. And to me, nothing could be more fascinating - nor more pressing, as we aim to create a world that allows *all* children to maximize their potential.\nProgram II has - in almost every way - defined my Duke experience! The research I've conducted comically mirrors the structure of my major. I've worked in three labs, one focused on metabolic influences on development, the second exploring the role of sensory sensitivity in the development of anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder (a lot of words meaning individual developmental trajectories!), and finally, one exploring the process of transition from childhood to adulthood for individuals with intellectual disabilities, particularly focusing on the systems they must navigate during this time. I've volunteered in public schools with kindergarten, elementary, middle, and high school students; and during the summer after my freshman year, I started an Individualized Attention Program at a summer program in a Title I school district. I'm a regular at the Duke Lenox Baker Children's Hospital right down the road; while also maintaining a relationship with the Primeros Pasos clinic in Xela Guatemala, helping with data analysis for the past two years. And as president of the Duke Special Olympics College Club, the athletes I work with every day contextualize my studies, reminding me why building systems that help people with all different developmental trajectories thrive is so critical.\nI chose Program II because the question that fascinated me never fit neatly into any major. I always felt more passionate about studying development than anything else - and PII gave me the opportunity to do just that.\nNothing was more challenging than narrowing down classes! I think my initial list was 200 courses long? Narrowing it down to the 17 I chose was exhausting, but also an incredibly exciting and empowering process.\nMy experiences with Program II played a major role in helping me to win the Truman Scholarship, a post-graduate scholarship that helps fund advance degrees for change agents who dream of a life in public service. That is me to a tee. For now, the plan is to go to medical school to study developmental pediatrics, while also gaining an advanced degree in education psychology. Long term, I aim to conduct research on the intersections of health, education, and community systems, with the end goal of influencing national child policy initiatives. Right after graduation, though, I'm headed to DC and then San Francisco - working on children's issues in parts of the country I haven't gotten to explore yet!", "type": "c4", "length": "3256", "entropy": "4.420425911321713", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4990786240786241", "brevity_score": "0.003105590062111783"}
{"text": "A mother and her children take a field trip around their neighborhood in Boston. They visit the butcher and bakery and even go to the ice cream parlor for a sundae. This book is a great way to introduce children to the concept of a neighbor and community helpers. It also has the bus driver Bill take the family home after a busy day. There are plenty of conversations and vocabulary words that can be incorporated with this book.\nWe determined that this book was a good book due to the illustrations and vocabulary that was presented in the book. It was also a \"good book\" because it showed the life of a child who lived in Boston, so it was culturally diverse. It showed the MBTA, the North End, etc. So overall it would be a good book for children to read.\nThis book was pretty cute. I liked how it described the girls' experience with the bus and their tradition of going to town with their mother to buy groceries. I think it would be a fun read for kids who aren't used to riding buses or having to shop at different markets like in this story. It would be fun to compare and contrast.\nNeat semi-autobiographical story about a girl's weekend trips into Boston with her mother and sister. I liked all the food mentioned especially!\nI thought this book was really sweet, loved all the Boston images.

{"text": "An experience with a new culture can force you to reexamine your relationship with your own.\nThese days, it\u2019s not cool to be a proud American. As the world\u2019s only superpower, with a government which believes it is its duty to involve itself all over the world, we\u2019re considered bullies. And fat, yet somehow with bad taste in food.\nIn all honesty, earlier this year, I probably would\u2019ve agreed with all of these things. There are many aspects of \u201cAmerica\u201d that I\u2019d prefer to distance myself from\u2014wars declared in the name of democracy and world peace, international intimidation, Twinkies, Hummers, Walmart, etc. Six months ago, I was more likely to identify myself as an \u201cItalian American,\u201d who cooks pasta far more often than hamburgers. My idea of Americans focused not on our commonalities, but on our differences.\nHowever, in the last year my life has changed dramatically. In late August, I arrived in Bologna, Italy. Five months later, I live in an apartment with an Italian (Valeria) and a Hungarian (Orsi: pronounced Or-shee). I\u2019m a student at the University of Bologna. I have friends who are Italian, Hungarian, Greek, French, Belgian, and a host of other nationalities.\nHere in Italy, it\u2019s impossible to hide my origins. Often, I even introduce myself, Noelle, Piacere (shake hands)\u2014sono americana. It\u2019s only a matter of time until it becomes obvious. When I first arrived, everyone could tell just by the way I dressed, in jeans and a T-shirt. My first evening in my new apartment, Valeria and I went out to see some live music. I put on a clean shirt with my jeans and converse. She gave me a look, and the next thing I knew I was putting on a skirt instead.\nThroughout the weeks, I realized the number of tendencies and habits that make me \u201cAmerican\u201d\u2014the quirks that compose American culture. Belting out \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d by Journey with great pride (Valeria walked in, laughed, and said, \u201cAll Americans love that song.\u201d), always preferring the informal to the formal, and becoming terribly uncomfortable when strangers invaded my precious \u201cpersonal bubble.\u201d For the first time in my life, I saw all of the little things that made me an \u201cAmerican\u201d without any special prefix or specification.\nOrsi and I went for a walk one day and found ourselves discussing this very topic. Each of us had arrived seeing ourselves as \u201cglobally minded,\u201d \u201cinternational\u201d people. But now, both of us clutch to our respective cultures with intense pride.\nPerhaps that\u2019s because, at times, we can feel them slipping away. Recently, I flew home to the States to spend Christmas with my family. I found myself speaking in two languages, unable to stop my mouth from starting in Italian, knowing full well that everyone understood English much better. On my first day home, I got dressed, went downstairs and realized that an outfit I\u2019d usually wear to go to class would be considered fancy here.\nOr, maybe it is because my being an American sometimes subjects me to criticism. Almost everyone I\u2019ve met while abroad has been incredibly kind, but occasionally someone decides to unload all of their complaints about the U.S. onto me. I\u2019ve heard critiques of American politics and foreign policy, American agriculture, and, of course, American food. I bravely defended barbecue for all of us.\nOr perhaps I clutch my American identity so tightly now because, for once, being \u201cAmerican\u201d is not something that I share with everyone around me, but is the very thing that makes me unique\u2014the thing that makes people say \u201cwow\u201d when they meet me and secretly wonder why in God\u2019s name I decided to leave. The fact that I am an American makes my roommates request brownies, pancakes, and other typically American dishes. In the States, meanwhile, I get requests for pasta and biscotti.\nWhen I met Orsi, she asked me what I liked about America. The first thing that struck me was the oddity of the question. The second was my lack of an answer. After thirty seconds of thinking, however, there were countless responses floating in my head.\nSo, it\u2019s taken me five months (with another five to go) of living outside America to understand what it means to be an American. I went abroad thinking I\u2019d experience another culture, but now I feel as though I\u2019m just discovering my own. Even though it may not be \u201ccool\u201d\u2014even though I still may not approve of needless wars, Twinkies, and Hummers, and even though I\u2019d eat pasta over a hamburger every day of the week\u2014I still love my country very much.\nI guess that brings me to the last American stereotype: According to my friend Matteo, Americans are all very proud to be American.\nNoelle Turtur is a third year in the College majoring in History.", "type": "c4", "length": "4675", "entropy": "4.4773290380956094", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4925623297716321", "brevity_score": "0.002155172413793107"}

I know I have been unresponsive to a lot of people recently and I do apologize for that. Currently I am finding it very difficult to keep up with my work load. This is, for the most part, a good thing. While that is true from the business stand point my body has been begging to differ for quite some time. Yesterday was my first day off in a while and I literally slept all day. I got home somewhere around 5:30am Sunday Night and the next thing I remember is waking up around 3pm. I remember getting a bottle of water and starting something off of my PVR but the next thing I remember is waking up at 4:30pm..... and then the next thing I remember is waking up at 6:30pm and realizing that I needed to be at the firehall at 7:30 for the membership meeting. The membership meeting went well and it also marked the end of my probationary period and they voted me in as a full member. I'm still trying to get into Loudoun County's fire \"academy\" because its really the only one that semi-fits my schedule and since its in Leesburg it's only a town over from the data center so I can make it to the data center before and/or after class. If they have room I will start that next month. Once I complete that (which would end in December or January), I will then be a certified firefighter and will be able to enter buildings, etc.\nThe week ahead of me is just as busy as last week. My one customer is still progressing in their move from one Equinix facility to another and that's been consuming a lot of my time. My other customers have had a steady flow of tickets as well and, thus, I am still behind. If this keeps up I may be hiring someone a lot sooner than I had ever dreamed. I guess this is a good thing but I really could use a vacation.\nSaturday I went to the Prince William County Fair with Sophie and Amber and that was really a good time to relax. I had a little bit of a rough time in missing my sisters.... that may sound odd but it was always a big deal when my sisters went to a fair or an amusement park and since I've moved to Virginia we haven't been able to do any of that at all..... I actually havent even made it to a park myself. The highlight of the whole day (and maybe my month) was that I took Amber on the Merry Go Round before we left. Seeing her smile was.... well, it was just awesome. At first I was afraid that she was getting scared and when the gears settled on the horse she was on and the horse jumped I was bracing for a scream.... she looked conerned for a brief second and then she just started laughing..... she loved it.... and I loved it.\nPlease keep me in your prayers.

The virus sickens as many as 21 million Americans each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leading to 70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths.\n\nResearchers at the Occupational Hygiene Unit at the Health and Safety Laboratory in Britain created \"Vomiting Larry\" to get a better idea of how the virus is able to spread so easily and quickly from person to person.\n\nVomiting Larry consists of a cylinder body filled with water mixed with florescent liquid, a head with an open mouth, and a pump to shoot the water through the mouth, similar to projectile vomit.\n\nAfter Larry throws up the florescent water, researchers measure how far the airborne vomit particles travel.\n\n\"Under normal lighting, you can only see the main area where Larry actually vomited,\" Catherine Makison-Booth, Larry's creator, told ABC News. \"However, under UV light, you can see the particles spread much further than that - in excess of three meters.\"\n\nThat means the area that needs to be sanitized when someone with norovirus throws up is bigger than previously thought.\n\nEarlier studies indicate the virus could live for 12 days or longer in the environment where somebody vomited, so the entire area needs to be cleaned with bleach as soon as possible after the vomiting occurred in order to stem the spread of the illness.\n\nBecause norovirus spreads quickly and easily from person to person, it can rapidly infect hundreds of people in a short amount of time.\n\n\"It can knock out a whole school, hospital, military base or off-shore rig, and there is currently no vaccine for it, so you really just have to let it run its course,\" Makison-Booth said.\n\nMakison-Booth said she doesn't know of any illness that spreads quite the way norovirus does, because it takes so little for a person to contract it.\n\n\"One only needs to ingest 20 to 25 viruses to become ill, compared to the hundreds of viruses it takes to contract influenza,\" Makison-Booth told ABC. \"When someone with norovirus vomits once, that's millions of viruses.\"\n\nNorovirus is also resistant to many typical cleaning products, like the kinds generally used to clean kitchens and bathrooms, as well as normal hand sanitizer. In order to really clean up after someone with norovirus throws up, \"bleach is definitely the way to go,\" Makison-Booth said.\n\nPeople infected with norovirus should try to stay away from other people for at least 48 hours after the symptoms stop.\n\nThe studies could soon become especially relevant, with news that norovirus cases in England this winter are up 72% from last year, according to the Health Protection Agency, including on ships making transatlantic crossing to the United States.", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "3221", "entropy": "4.439562253103816", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4743868363862155", "brevity_score": "0.0033557046979865884"}

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 The startup is housed in a garage-like space in San Francisco's tech-heavy South of Market neighborhood, but it isn't like most of its neighbors that develop software, websites and mobile-phone apps. Its mission is to find plant replacements for eggs.\n\nInside, research chefs bake cookies and cakes, whip up batches of flavored mayonnaise and pan-fry omelets and French toast \u2014 all without eggs.\n\nFunded by prominent Silicon Valley investors and Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Hampton Creek Foods seeks to disrupt a global egg industry that backers say wastes energy, pollutes the environment, causes disease outbreaks and confines chickens to tiny spaces.\n\nThe company, which just started selling its first product \u2014 Just Mayo mayonnaise \u2014 at Whole Foods Markets, is part of a new generation of so-called food-tech ventures that aim to change the way we eat.\n\n\"There's nothing to indicate that this will be a trend that will end anytime soon,\" said Anand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights, a New York firm that tracks venture capital investment. \"Sustainability and challenges to the food supply are pretty fundamental issues.\"\n\nVenture capital firms, which invest heavily in early-stage technology companies, poured nearly $350 million into food-related startups last year, compared with less than $50 million in 2008, according to the firm.\n\nPlant-based alternatives to eggs, poultry and other meat could be good for the environment because it could reduce consumption of meat, which requires large amounts of land, water and crops to produce, backers say.\n\nIt could also benefit people's health, especially in heavy meat-eating countries like the U.S., and reduce outbreaks of diseases such as avian flu, they say.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is that people who consume a lot of meat really like meat, and to convince them to try something different may be extremely difficult,\" said Claire Kremen, faculty co-director of the Berkeley Food Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe American Egg Board, which represents U.S. producers, said eggs can't be replaced.\n\n\"Our customers have said they're not interested in egg substitutes. They want real, natural eggs with their familiar ingredients,\" Mitch Kanter, executive director of the board-funded Egg Nutrition Center, said in a statement.\n\nThe industry has reduced its water use and greenhouse gas emissions, and hens are living longer due to better health and nutrition, he said.\n\nHampton Creek's quest to replace the ubiquitous chicken egg is also backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Khosla Ventures, a venture capital fund started by Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla.\n\nIn its food lab, biochemists grind up beans and peer through microscopes to study their molecular structure, looking for plants that can fulfill the culinary functions of eggs. So far, the company has analyzed some 1,500 types of plants from more than 60 countries.\n\nThe research has resulted in 11 \"hits,\" said Josh Tetrick, the company's CEO.\n\n\"Our approach is to use plants that are much more sustainable \u2014 less greenhouse gas emissions, less water, no animal involved and a whole lot more affordable \u2014 to create a better food system,\" said the former linebacker on West Virginia University's football team.\n\nThe company's first product \u2014 the mayonnaise \u2014 is sold for roughly the same price as the traditional variety. It soon hopes to start selling cookie dough and a batter that scrambles like eggs when fried in a pan.\n\n\"The egg is a miracle, so one of the hardest parts of replacing it is all the functions that it can do,\" said Chris Jones, the company's culinary director of innovations and a former contestant on Bravo TV's Top Chef.\n\nWhile Hampton Creek takes aim at the egg, another Gates-backed company is targeting the chicken itself.\n\nBeyond Meat, located in Southern California, sells \"chicken-free strips,\" which have the taste and stringy texture of poultry but are made from plant protein. It is sold at Whole Foods and natural food stores. It's also working on a product that mimics beef.\n\nInside its test kitchen in El Segundo, Caitlin Grady, the company's culinary ambassador, stir-fried the strips with broccoli, onion, peppers and sesame oil. \"I cooked it just like a regular stir-fry, but I don't have to worry about the meat being raw,\" Grady said.\n\nThe company is also funded by Obvious Corp., a startup incubator founded by Twitter's founders, and Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers, one of Silicon Valley's premier venture capital firms.\n\n\"It can fit in a vegan's diet. It can fit in a carnivore's diet,\" said Beyond Meat CEO Ethan Brown. \"We're trying to appeal to the full range of consumers that are making some shift toward healthier protein.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Raquel Maria Dillon contributed to this report from El Segundo, Calif.", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "4846", "entropy": "4.548730698935333", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.49670917317976143", "brevity_score": "0.0021097046413502043"}
{"text": "By Eric Peters, Automotive Columnist\n\nIs 16 too young to drive?\n\nIf you\u2019re 16. you probably think not. But it\u2019s those over 16 \u2014 adults like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\u2019s Adrian Lund \u2014 who will get to be the deciders on this one. Lund and some others want to push the age at which a person can get their first driver\u2019s license to 17 or even 18.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s all about \u201csafety.\u201d\n\nLund \u2014 a professional nag who heads an organization of nags \u2014 says that teenage drivers are a menace to themselves and others and wants to use the billy stick of the federal government (via withheld highway funds) to compel states to raise their legal driving age \u2014 just as the billy stick of federal money was used to impose the 55 mph speed limit, virtual Prohibition of alcohol and \u201cprimary enforcement\u201d seat belt laws.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s not merely \u201cfor the children\u201d \u2014 it actually involves them.\n\nAnd Lund is partially right. Teenagers do get into more than their fair share of wrecks. But is this due to their age \u2014 or their lack of training/experience?\n\nThere are some very young pro drivers \u2014 from NHRA to NASCAR. Maybe not sixteen-year-olds, but not far removed. At 15 or 16, some of these kids are better drivers than most of us will ever be. What to make of this fact?\n\nGranted, these are exceptional kids \u2014 but the point\u2019s not invalid: Experience and training probably mean a whole lot more than age \u2014 as such.\n\nWill raising the age to 17 or 18 give a kid more experience \u2014 or less? Maybe the age at which we begin to train kids to drive should be lowered, not raised. Does it make more \u2014 or less \u2014 sense to toss a kid with zero hours behind the wheel a set of car keys at 17 or 18, when he is inches way from being legally free of any parental oversight whatsoever?\n\nMaybe it would make more sense to begin teaching kids how to drive around 14 or 15 \u2014 easing them into it gradually, and with supervision \u2014 so that by the time they are 17 or 18 they have three or four years of experience behind them. That\u2019s actually the way it used to be done, until public institutions such as public schools took over from parents and the whole process became bureaucratized and officialized \u2014 but with less than stellar results.\n\nDriving is, after all, a skill like any other; it is not mastered overnight \u2014 or after a few weeks of classroom instruction and a couple of hours in the seat.\n\nLogic says start them sooner, not later.\n\nBut that would make sense \u2014 and making sense is what IIHS is not all about. It exists to harp over problems often directly ginned up by its own propaganda. Mandatory buckle-up laws are an example of this. Ditto the neo-Prohibitionist crusade that has gone way beyond a legitimate effort to deal with drunk drivers that now mercilessly prosecutes people with trace amounts of alcohol in their system \u2014 as little as .06 or even .04 BAC, the level an average person can reach after having had a single glass of wine over dinner.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nThe other half of the equation when it comes to new/teenage drivers is proper instruction. What we do in this country \u2014 for the most part \u2014 is woefully inadequate. Many parents set poor examples \u2014 or are simply ill-equipped to properly instruct their kids in safe/competent driving. Ditto the so-called \u201cschools\u201d (especially those offered by the public schools) and the at-best cursory testing done by most DMVs before that first license is issued.\n\nWe don\u2019t really show kids how to drive \u2014 especially how to handle emergency, such as a slide on black ice. Instead, we chant cant at them that\u2019s obvious BS, such as \u201cspeed kills\u201d \u2014 the driving equivalent of the BS about \u201cmarihuana\u201d that\u2019s peddled to them in Just Say No sessions. Kids are smart enough to see through this \u2014 but immature enough to then regard everything they\u2019re taught by adults as BS.\n\nThis is dangerous.\n\nFar better to really teach them \u2014 and to be honest with them.\n\nI\u2019d be ready to lay serious cash on the table to bet Lund that if you took an average 14 or 15 year old and had him or her trained by an expert instructor and properly supervised for a year or two before a provisional license was granted \u2014 after which the kid would still be monitored and quickly reined in at the first sign of reckless or incompetent behavior \u2014 the whole \u201cteenage driver\u201d thing would just disappear.\n\nProblem is, there\u2019s no money in that. Finding solutions to problems is not what IIS wants. IIHS wants crusades that never end. Just like MADD; just like politicians.\n\nJust like the whole lot of them.\n\nComments?\n\nwww.ericpetersautos.com", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "4560", "entropy": "4.48745543088174", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4912243150684932", "brevity_score": "0.002309468822170917"}
{"text": "On a chilly April morning, retired construction worker Philip Smith was driving down a Lake County road when police say he sailed through a red light, smashing his Jeep into the side of a school bus.\n\nMost of the 35 children aboard went to the hospital with minor injuries; Smith died at the scene. Authorities tested his blood and determined that the crash had been the result of Smith \"having impaired judgment by having multiple drugs in his system.\"\n\nWhat were those drugs? A sedative and a narcotic painkiller -- both medications prescribed by Smith's doctors.\n\nIllinois' new medical marijuana law has started a debate about the safety of people driving after smoking pot, but experts say millions get behind the wheel every day under the influence of powerful medications that, while perfectly legal, can have dangerous consequences on the road.\n\nNarcotic painkillers such as codeine and oxycodone can cause fatigue and mental clouding, while sedatives can slow reflexes. A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study named a range of other drugs, from antidepressants to beta blockers to allergy pills, as \"potentially driver-impairing medications.\"\n\nThat puts many patients in a difficult dilemma. They're allowed to drive with these meds in their systems, but there's no easy way to know the dosage or drug interactions that could make driving unsafe. If they're pulled over or involved in a crash, a doctor's order may not save them from being charged with DUI.\n\n\"If we think that a medication or combination (of drugs) is affecting your ability to drive safely, it's immaterial whether you've been prescribed them,\" said Michael Ori, who prosecutes traffic offenses for the Lake County state's attorney's office.\n\nMuch of the research on prescription drugs and driving has centered on narcotic medications. Scientists have long believed that patients on stable, long-term regimens of opioids -- opium-like painkillers -- develop a tolerance that allows them to drive safely, but recent studies have complicated that picture.\n\nOne found that high doses of painkillers render a driver more likely to be involved in a crash, a conclusion that prompted a medical journal to editorialize that doctors should \"weigh the risk of road trauma into our decisions about the benefits and harms of opioids.\"\n\nAnother study found that motorists taking the medications are more likely to perform \"unsafe driving actions\" that make them responsible for roughly 150 fatal crashes in the U.S. each year.\n\nThat might not sound like many, considering that more than 200 million opioid painkiller prescriptions are written each year, but research statistician Sacha Dubois said his calculations were conservative: They didn't include crashes in which people were maimed rather than killed, for instance, or those in which painkillers had been mixed with alcohol.\n\n\"This is like a plane crash a year,\" he said. \"If any company had a plane crash where everybody died, we'd be concerned about it.\"\n\nPhilip Smith, 62, of Beach Park, had worked in construction until chronic back and neck pain forced him to retire, according to an interview his wife gave to investigators. A few weeks before the fatal crash he slipped and fractured a vertebra, an injury that put him in a back brace.\n\nSmith had been on \"multiple pain management medications for many years\" under the care of a Lincolnshire specialist, his wife said, and was taking daily doses of morphine and diazepam, the generic version of Valium.\n\nDr. Jerrold Leikin, director of medical toxicology at NorthShore University HealthSystem, reviewed Smith's toxicology report at the Tribune's request and said the results were \"compatible with impairment.\"\n\n\"These are all central nervous system depressants ... that can slow down reaction time, impair your judgment, (create) issues with multitasking, with coordination and perception, primarily visual perception,\" he said. \"All those things can be affected by drugs of this type.\"\n\nSmith's wife declined interview requests from the Tribune. She has filed a lawsuit against the bus company, Durham School Services, claiming it was actually the bus driver who ran the red light.\n\nChicago-area prosecutors say they have brought charges against drivers who appeared to be intoxicated by lawfully prescribed medications, but the cases aren't easy to win. If a motorist has any trace of an illegal drug such as cocaine or heroin in his system, he is presumed to be under the influence. If he's taking something his doctor prescribed, prosecutors have to prove he was impaired.\n\nThey try to do that through field sobriety tests or the results of a blood screen (typically given only when there's a crash), but that can leave plenty of room for a defense attorney to sow reasonable doubt.\n\n\"It's the exception for the state to win a case like that, not the rule,\" said Wheaton lawyer Donald Ramsell, a specialist in DUI law.\n\nJames Zacny, a University of Chicago anesthesiology professor who has studied the effects of opioid painkillers on driving, said those drugs, when used alone at an appropriate dose, can actually improve motorists' performance by allowing them to focus on the road instead of their pain.\n\nThe problem comes when opioids are combined with other drugs, such as sedatives, he said. The interaction's effect on driving has not been well-researched, but Zacny said it would likely cause problems.\n\n\"It's a synergistic effect, like one plus one equals three,\" he said. \"It's a stronger effect than if you doubled the dose of the opioid.\"\n\nSome doctors are cautious even when drug interactions are not an issue. Lynn Webster, a Salt Lake City physician who is president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said he advises patients taking narcotic painkillers to stay off the road unless they can prove they're not impaired with a session in a driving simulator.\n\nHe acknowledged, though, that it's just a recommendation -- patients do not need their doctor's permission to drive.\n\n\"It's often a trade-off for patients,\" he said. \"They have to assume the risk of driving, but I think most physicians would advise them not to.\"\n\nThere are no firm criteria to guide physicians and patients about when it's safe to drive with painkillers or other medications, and some experts say the subject -- rife with tough decisions about potentially sacrificing one's independence -- is rarely discussed in doctors' offices.\n\nOne longtime pain patient in DuPage County said he has never spoken to his physician about it. The man, a 66-year-old retired materials handler who asked not to be named to preserve his privacy, said that since 2009 he has taken Vicodin and tramadol, both opioids, to deal with severe spinal pain stemming from rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHe is careful not to take more pills than directed or drink alcohol, he said, and doesn't believe the drugs have affected his driving. The one moving violation on his record since he started taking pain medication, a 2010 ticket for running a red light, was simply bad judgment and had nothing to do with his meds, he said.\n\n\"I've never felt out of control. I've never felt incapacitated,\" he said. \"You grow accustomed to this. The only thing that changes are the levels of pain during the day. I would think that not taking pain relief is detrimental to your driving.\"\n\nDr. Brian Wilhelmi, a Phoenix physician who has researched opioid-related DUIs, said that as America grows older and more obese -- two populations particularly reliant on prescription drugs -- the problem will demand more attention from doctors, policymakers and law enforcement professionals.\n\n\"I think this is an issue that will reach a tipping point with these kinds of accidents, and we'll decide to get serious,\" he said. \"I definitely sense that it's coming down the road.\"\n\nCopyright 2013 - Chicago Tribune\n\nMcClatchy-Tribune News Service", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "7879", "entropy": "4.451071105140237", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4609722045944917", "brevity_score": "0.0014970059880239628"}

This week, at a conference for Catholics who have \u201csame-sex urges,\u201d the Reverend John Riccardo likened gay sex to putting a bagel in your ear. From The Advocate:\n\n\u201cHe said he tells students, what if \u2018I just rip open a bagel, I take it, and I cram it in my ear. What would you say? When they respond, \u2018That doesn\u2019t go there,\u2019 he says, \u2018Exactly,\u2019 and that doing so \u2018will ruin your ear canal.\u2019\u201d\n\nFirst of all, putting a bagel in your ear will not \u201cruin your ear canal.\u201d As is very common with both penetrative anal and, by the way, vaginal sex, you may experience some slight tearing, but the great thing about the human body is that it has a cardiovascular and immune system for healing those slight tears. It\u2019s just the cost of putting a bagel in your ear, or a penis in your anus or vagina. Inasmuch as that\u2019s the case, yes, I guess that putting a bagel in your ear is kind of like putting a penis in the orifices in your undercarriage.\n\nBut otherwise, no. If you\u2019re doing anal sex right, it shouldn\u2019t be like stuffing a bagel into your ear, because theoretically, the penis going into the anus should be hard (is this news to anyone?). Men who have more experience with anal sex could correct me about this if I\u2019m wrong, of course, since I don\u2019t have a penis.\n\nIn terms of the argument that \u201cThat doesn\u2019t go there!\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s not natural!\u201d, I don\u2019t know, man. The human race has been enjoying anal sex, gay sex, and lesbian sex for a long, long, long, long time. I wish that these priests would do themselves a favor and read historical documents about sexual practices before, during, and after the time of Jesus, because they describe some sex acts that are pretty lurid by today\u2019s standards. (The Turin Erotic Papyrus, Moche pots, and Babylonian artifacts all come to mind.) So apparently this God or whomever created humans to love doin\u2019 it in the butt. Penises absolutely belong in anuses, or mouths, or vaginas, or hands, or even ears, if that\u2019s your thing. Who cares?\n\nHave fun, kids, and just remember to keep some Monistat on hand if you\u2019re going to put bagels anywhere other than your mouth.\n\n[The Advocate]\n\n[Times of Israel]\n\nImage via Shutterstock.\n\nOriginal by Rebecca Vipond Brink", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "2490", "entropy": "4.519222463203975", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.5218921032056294", "brevity_score": "0.0036231884057970902"}

From there I started reading more and more. I\u2019ve always been a math guy and the two sort of go hand-in-hand. I like baseball and I like math.\n\n\u201cIn 2008, I thought I\u2019d had a good year. I won 12 games and had a 4.40 ERA. That wasn\u2019t great, but I was like, \u2018that\u2019s not bad.\u2019 But the more I read, the more I came to realize it\u2019s not about wins. It\u2019s about the quality of the innings you pitch, and my quality wasn\u2019t that good.\n\n\u201cIn 2009, I started out the season with three eight-inning starts and only gave up three runs total. But I only struck out 10 guys in the 24 innings. I read somewhere that I was going to regress. I thought \u2018What?\u2019 It didn\u2019t make sense to me. That\u2019s when I began poking into it, but I mostly brushed it aside. Then, in 2010, I started reading more and more. I began to realize wins were a result of quality innings, not the barometer of how good you are.\u201d\n\nOn what he considers the most important pitching stat: \u201cFielding Independent Pitching [FIP]. That\u2019s what a pitcher can control, and the lower it is \u2014 just by default \u2014 the lower your ERA is going to be over the course of time. Not walking guys, getting strikeouts and ground balls, and not giving up home runs, are the keys. I don\u2019t ever want to walk a guy and would strike everyone out if I could. If I can\u2019t strike them out, I\u2019d like to jam them so they hit a pop up to the infield, or a ground ball.\u201d\n\nOn if his 13.5 K/9 is sustainable: \u201cThe last two years it went up. My swinging-strike rate has gone up. I know my chase-rate is down, but my in-zone swing-and-misses are higher this year than last year. Obviously it\u2019s a small sample.\n\n\u201cSo, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d like to think so. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a stat for an expected strikeout rate based on swings-and-misses and chases. I guess maybe where I\u2019m at is a little high, but I think I can improve from last year when I was at 10 per nine.\u201d\n\nOn his O-Swing% [38.9] and Z-Swing% [71.4]: \u201cI typically know what gets swung at \u2014 it\u2019s usually fastballs up and out of the zone, and sliders below the zone. Having a higher O-Swing rate obviously means they\u2019re chasing pitches, but it also means they don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming \u2014 or they can\u2019t react. That\u2019s a good indicator of how much chance a hitter has. Getting big-league hitters to swing at pitches out of the zone is hard to do. Getting big-league hitters to swing and miss at pitches in the strike is even harder. But you can make quality pitches in the strike zone, and I feel my stuff allows me to pitch in the strike zone.\u201d\n\nOn his F-Strike% [74.4]: \u201cIt\u2019s a known fact that a guy hitting 0-1 is significantly worse than a guy hitting 1-0. Getting to 0-1 is also the quickest way to 0-2. At 0-2, a hitter has a very small chance and that chance is probably a single. But you can\u2019t just throw it down the middle of the plate. For me, getting to 0-1 is just as likely to be a competitive slider down in the zone, or even below the zone.\n\n\u201cIn most of the situations I\u2019ve pitched in this year, we\u2019ve been leading. Guys are typically taking a pitch in that situation \u2014 I\u2019ve known they might be giving me that first pitch \u2014 but even so, you never throw a ball down the middle. I might throw a four-seamer in or I might throw a slider.\u201d\n\nOn his BB/9 [3.38]: \u201cI think my walk rate right now is mostly based on small sample size. I did this last year. I had a game against the A\u2019s where I walked three guys in one inning, and outside of that I only walked 12 or 13 guys all year. This year, two of my five walks came in one game against the Rangers. Good command is the last thing to come. As the season goes on, I get more comfortable with my delivery.\u201d\n\nOn his GB% [26.1]: \u201cThere\u2019s a small sample size there as well, but so far this year I\u2019ve struggled with extension. As a result, I haven\u2019t had as much downward action on my ball. But I pitch more with four-seamers now, and\u2026 I don\u2019t know what the swing rate is on my slider, but I would imagine that\u2019s my main ground-ball pitch. I haven\u2019t gotten a whole lot of balls in play on my slider.\n\n\u201cThe two-seamers haven\u2019t been there. I didn\u2019t throw a lot of them last year. From 2011 to 2012, the usage of those two kind of flip-flopped. My four-seamer comes in harder, so I\u2019m throwing more of those.\u201d\n\nOn his HR/9 [0.84] and HR/FB [10.0]: \u201cIn 2011, I only gave up two home runs. I got a ton of ground balls \u2014 it was just under 50 percent \u2014 and last year my fly-ball percentage and home-run percentages went up. I think I was right around league average on home-runs-per-fly ball. I would assume that this year, at whatever point that stabilizes, I\u2019ll be around 10 or 11 percent. That\u2019s why I\u2019d like to get more ground balls.\n\n\u201cGreg Maddux said to me at the World Baseball Classic this year, \u2018If you get your balls hit in front of the outfielders, you did your job.\u2019 Some balls are going to fall in and there are going to be line drives hit right at guys. It\u2019s about not letting the ball go over the fence.\u201d\n\nOn his ERA [4.22] and FIP [2.34]: \u201cMy [current] ERA isn\u2019t a concern to me. My main concern is what I\u2019ve done in the seven games where I\u2019ve come in and gotten a save. I\u2019ve given up something like four hits and one run and struck out 13 or 14 guys, in those seven games.\n\n\u201cIn one game we lost 16-5 [to the Mets] and I gave up two runs. In another game we lost 7-2 to the Rangers and I gave up two. Outside of that, I\u2019ve given up one run. As time goes on, my ERA is going to get closer to my FIP. The more I minimize home runs, the lower my ERA is going to get.\u201d\n\nOn being 7-for-7 in save opportunities: \u201cDo I particularly agree with closers in baseball? That\u2019s a tough question that I ask myself. But it\u2019s my job, and when I go out there to do that job, saves are the most important thing to me. If I throw a quality inning, that\u2019s the result I should get.\u201d", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "6640", "entropy": "4.611636795692119", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.43658679135008766", "brevity_score": "0.0018621973929236577"}

A Q&A with Anita Heward of the Google Lunar X Prize.\n\nEditor's note: this article was written by high school students from the ESOF2014 Academy. You can read more about ESOF and Future Academy here.\n\nWould you like to win $30 million? If so, all you have to do is build your own space rocket, get it on the Moon, and have it launch a robot that can roll 500 meters away from the rocket while it's streaming HD photos and video back to Earth.\n\nIf you think that sounds easy then Google's Lunar X Prize might be something for you.\n\nPerhaps it's an exciting challenge for young students with dreams of space travel -- or a way to get them engaged with science.\n\nThree high school students got a chance to speak with Anita Heward who manages the Google Lunar X Prize in Europe. Here is what came out of that conversation:\n\nSciencenordic: can you explain what the Google Lunar X Prize is about?\n\nHeward: \"The competition is a 30 million dollar competition. You have to land a robot on the moon, and it has to roll 500 meters, and send back HD pictures and video. If you do that you claim the first prize of 30 million dollars. The 2nd prize is 5 million dollars.\n\nThere are also bonus prizes for doing miscellaneous things such as collecting water, taking pictures of the Apollo site or the heritage site on the Moon. Last year we introduced some other prizes called the milestone prizes.\n\nTeams that can demonstrate that their equipment is able to do tasks or complete the challenge can get some money in advance -- we hope that can help teams to complete the challenge.\"\n\nFacts This article was written by students as a part of ESOF2014\u2019s Future Academy-programme. 175 second-year high school students helped cover the huge science conference that took place in Copenhagen from June 21 to 26. More than 4,500 researchers from around the world participated in the conference. Read more about the Future Academy here\n\nWhy do we want to go back to the Moon?\n\n\"It's been a long time since humans were on the Moon and we've had several robot missions since -- last year a Chinese robot landed on the moon. The more we learn out about the Moon, the more we realise that we don\u2019t know enough about it.\n\nWe still don\u2019t have a precise answer to how the Moon was formed and there are many scientific questions that we would like to know more about.\n\nWe're also trying to analyse the Moon because we know that it's very rich on resources and has high quantities of rare metals -- higher than what's on Earth. There's also a lot of water trapped in ice on the Moon's two poles.\n\nAt some point we can start using these resources if we can find the means to harvest them. The Moon can also be used as a station for future space missions.\"\n\nWho is sponsoring the $30 million prize?\n\n\"The Google Lunar X Prize is run by the X Prize foundation, which is a non-profit organization that aims to stimulate innovation through interactive competitions. The X Prize Foundation does all kinds of competitions with all sorts of challenges.\n\nLunar X is the biggest one run right now, but beside that the foundation also deals with things like the ocean and literacy. All of this is sponsored by Google who very generously provides the prize money and covers the operational costs of a competition like this.\"", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "3342", "entropy": "4.4951899836237015", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.46833930704898447", "brevity_score": "0.003184713375796171"}

If the team would not benefit even if the players were being coached by Bill Belichick of the dynastic New England Patriots, then it is a talent issue. Since many of us got to witness first-hand the performance of a good team on Friday -- the Calgary Stampeders -- the comparison is there to be made.

The Winnipeg offensive line also has a multiple all-star on it in Glenn January and no rookies, so you would think the lines would be somewhat comparable.\n\nWhen you look at the receivers Calgary used Friday night, only Nik Lewis is of all-star calibre, with just one more all-CFL recognition than Terrence Edwards. Looking at their other starting receivers, Hawthorne is a CFL rookie, Sinopoli is playing receiver for the first time in his career, and the Bombers let backup Greg Carr walk and bounce around the league a long time ago before he resurfaced in Calgary and exacted some revenge.\n\nAt running back, Jon Cornish is a bona fide superstar in the CFL, but is he really that much more capable than Chad Simpson, who had three years of spot duty in the NFL before he arrived on our doorstep? Those who consider the NFL the holy grail of professional football talent would have to put Simpson on comparable terms with Cornish simply because of his resum\u00a9.\n\nSo a comparative analysis between the assets of these two offences tells us the only glaring disparity is at quarterback, but we couldn't have realized that until we saw both Bo Levi Mitchell and Justin Goltz start for the first time.\n\nEven with this apparent critical difference in inherent talent at pivot, you have to look at how the Stampeders and Bombers differed in their game plans in accommodating the first starts of these QBs.\n\nCalgary didn't ask much of Bo Levi Mitchell at the start. They began with a series of quick passes and a steady diet of Cornish so Bo Levi could gain confidence, get some momentum and get into a rhythm.

{"text": "Thoughtful Americans have long wondered how it is that fundamentalist Christians--followers of someone who preached pacifism and tolerance--became the poster boy for hate speech, touting \"moral values\" indistinguishable from those of the Taliban. They wonder why, for example, fundamentalist Christians so seldom quote from the New Testament--which is supposedly what Christianity is all about--but prefer citing the Torah and Old Testament prophets.\n\nOne reason is that the Old Testament is full of murder, vindictiveness, and genocide--all supposedly ordered by God. So when fundamentalists want a Biblical excuse for hate speech and hate crimes--which they seem to need with considerable frequency--they turn to Old Testament sources.\n\nChristian homophobes, for example, carry signs saying 'God hates fags', which they justify by claiming that Leviticus 18:22 (condemning male homosexuality as \"abomination\") is the 'word of God'. Yet more than a third of the entire book of Leviticus is devoted to God's detailed instructions on the proper manner of making burnt offerings of animals to Him. (The rest deals with keeping Jewish dietary laws, avoiding pollution from inadvertent contact with menstruating women, forbidding haircuts and beard trimming, justifying slavery, and saying anyone who swears should be stoned to death). Why doesn't God hate those who fail to make offerings in the exact manner He so carefully spelled out in chapter after chapter? Since fundamentalists feel comfortable ignoring 95% of the 'word of God' in Leviticus, why have they latched onto this isolated phrase? If \"God hates fags\", then God must feel positively murderous toward people who don't make burnt offerings of animal carcasses in the precise manner so carefully indicated, and in such extreme detail. (God must also hate people who eat lobster, shrimp and pork, which are also \"abominations\" according to Leviticus).\n\nIt's startling, in fact, how rarely fundamentalist Christians mention the sayings of Jesus. 'Morality' to them means the sexual inhibitions of ancient Middle Eastern patriarchies. They seem to be nostalgic for the pruderies of the 1950s, when the Hays office decreed that movies couldn't show pajama-clad married couples in bed together lest it incite teenage moviegoers to fornication. This obsession with sexuality is surprising, since Jesus seemed to have very little interest in the topic. In the four Gospels there are only four statements about sexuality, and these deal with adultery and divorce rather than sex per se. That is, with relationships--with causing injury to another.\n\nCompare this with the nineteen statements Jesus makes about the importance of giving, and the value of divesting oneself of money and possessions. Yet we seldom hear fundamentalist Christians saying it's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven. Or quoting the ten statements exhorting us to turn the other cheek--a Christian idea that seems to be anathema to hate-filled fundamentalists.\n\nThe Bible becomes the 'Word of God' when a bigot wants to use it to bludgeon his neighbor, and a mere archaic relic when it would be inconvenient for him to take it seriously. Fundamentalists of all persuasions--Christian, Muslim, Jewish--often manage to find some sort of backing for their hatreds in their sacred texts; for these texts were written in societies that were misogynistic, militaristic, and rigidly authoritarian--written, furthermore, by men who believed the earth was flat.\n\nThe reason why so many fundamentalist Christians are so notoriously \"unChristian\" is simple: for the majority of Christians (Quakers are among many notable exceptions) Christianity isn't about the teachings of Jesus, and never was. The early church fathers knew that Jesus' rather Buddhist message of nonviolence and voluntary poverty wouldn't fly in the Graeco-Roman world, let alone in the Middle East. The idea of a Redeemer on the other hand--someone who would voluntarily sacrifice Himself for humanity and their sins--was very popular. Instead of having to give up their worldly goods and espouse non-violence, all the Romans had to do was believe in the miraculous stories surrounding Jesus' birth and death, which was easy for them, since such stories had been told about pagan gods and heroes and were already familiar.\n\nChristianity as it exists among fundamentalists isn't about behaving like Jesus. It's all about faith--about believing the story. The underlying message seems to be: you can behave any way you want as long as you believe the story and say you're sorry before you die. Following the teachings of Jesus is much too demanding, whereas with the Christianity of fundamentalists all you have to do is shut your mind off.\n\nThere ought to be a term that would designate those who actually follow the teachings of Jesus, since the word \"Christian\" has been largely divorced from those teachings, and so polluted by fundamentalists that it has come to connote their polar opposite: intolerance, vindictive hatred, and bigotry.", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "5078", "entropy": "4.427314621289212", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.47006695549428906", "brevity_score": "0.002183406113537125"}

{"text": "Donald Trump has shown in his short time as president that he will take any opportunity to go against what his predecessors have done, regardless of whether it might improve the situation. His unilateral decisions on healthcare, taxation, immigration, and now the Middle East (Anger as Trump declares Jerusalem Israel\u2019s capital, 7 December), have been taken without informed advice or any understanding of the likely consequences. To say, as Trump does, that recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is furthering the peace process is as divorced from sane thinking as saying that pouring petrol on a smouldering fire will put it out. Fortunately, the countries that agree with his action can be counted on the thumb of one small hand. He faces unanimous condemnation from statesmen and politicians who, unlike him, know more of the Middle East than the inside of the gold-plated palaces of Saudi billionaires.\n\nTrump\u2019s error on Jerusalem is a disaster for the Arab world \u2026 and the US too | Rashid Khalidi Read more\n\nPerhaps his action, which legitimises the illegal theft of Palestinian land by the Israelis, will give the kiss of death to the so-called two-state solution and encourage those countries \u2013 most of the world \u2013 that are shocked by America\u2019s abandonment of even the appearance of balance, to support moves towards one single state of all its inhabitants between the Jordan and the Mediterranean. The only people who would suffer in such a state would be parties and politicians like Netanyahu who thrive on the racist concept that Palestinians and Jews can never live together in peace. In fact, they did exactly that for hundreds of years until Britain encouraged the influx of hundreds of thousands of European Jews who had no interest in sharing the land with its indigenous Arab inhabitants.\n\nKarl Sabbagh\n\nAuthor, Palestine: A Personal History\n\n\u2022 Trump\u2019s decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and start the move to relocate the US embassy goes against every UN resolution and the beliefs of every European state as well as the Arab countries he has been trying to cultivate this last six months or more. Personally I feel angry at the wilful support of a regime which, if it wasn\u2019t Israel, would be condemned as a rogue state. This one-sided decision will release a pent-up fury, where Britain has a lot to answer for \u2013 we held the mandate and promised the Palestinians their rights, but abandoned them.\n\nTo assuage the fury, the least the UK could do is immediately recognise the state of Palestine based on the 1967 borders. After the Liberal Democrats changed their policy at the last conference, there is now a majority for such a move. Done urgently we might cool the situation. I believe most EU countries would follow suit. It is also Europe, not the US, where the solution lies to getting the Zionists to negotiate in good faith. It is where they sell most of their products.\n\nIsrael not only ignores every UN resolution that references its ethnic cleansing and creation of an apartheid state, but every day carries out night raids and blocks people going about their peaceful business. Last week there were shots fired at fishing vessels, farms and worse still at a funeral, there were night raids on two villages, five attacks on houses, plus 16 \u201cflying checkpoints\u201d. This sort of happening is an everyday occurrence.\n\nPeter Downey\n\nBath\n\nWhat does US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital mean?

They might instead rediscover a clarity of purpose found in a return to principle. No ethnic discrimination, universal human rights, upholding international law, one person one vote; and support for all principled non-violent means that uphold these ideals in an effort to liberate both peoples from the current impasse.

This is surely a good time to progress the two-state solution most of the rest of the world seems to want as a part of a vision of a more hopeful political future.

Why let Trump, or any other foreign head of state, prevent them?\n\nAndrew Anderson\n\nEdinburgh\n\n\u2022 In the space of a week, Donald Trump uses Twitter to promote a neo-Nazi group in Britain, and panders to Benjamin Netanyahu by recognising Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital. I hope those who cast criticism of Israel as \u201cantisemitism\u201d, often as a backdoor route to attacking Jeremy Corbyn, will reflect on the toxic nexus between the racist hard right in the US and the nationalist hard right in Israel.

This change of US policy will add to the sense of isolation and hopelessness among Palestinians, and will further set back the possibility of positive change toward meaningful justice and political rights for them.

{"text": "NASA's Mars rover Curiosity took this self-portrait, composed of more than 50 images using its robotic arm-mounted MAHLI camera, on Feb. 3, 2013. The image shows Curiosity at the John Klein drill site. A drill hole is visible at bottom left.\n\nNASA's Mars rover Curiosity has revealed no trace of methane, a potential sign of primitive life, on the Martian surface, contradicting past evidence of the gas spotted by spacecraft orbiting the Red Planet, researchers say.\n\nThe Mars methane discovery, or rather the lack thereof, adds new fuel to the debate over whether the gas is truly present on Mars. And not all scientists are convinced that methane is missing on Mars.\n\nThe first and only attempts to search for life on Mars were the Viking missions, launched in 1975. Those probes failed to find organic compounds in Martian soils, apparently ruling out the possibility of extant life on the Red Planet. [7 Biggest Mars Mysteries of All Time]\n\nBut in the past decade, probes orbiting Mars and telescopes on Earth have detected what appeared to be plumes of methane gas from the Red Planet. The presence of colorless, odorless, flammable methane on Mars, the simplest organic molecule, helped revive the possibility of life once existing, or even currently living, just below the planet's surface.\n\nOn Earth, much of the methane in the atmosphere is released by life-forms, such as cattle. Scientists have suspected that methane stays stable in the Martian atmosphere for only about 300 years, so whatever is generating this gas did so recently.\n\nNow, the new findings from NASA's Curiosity rover unveiled online today (Sept. 19) in the journal Science suggest that, at most, only trace amounts of methane exist on Mars.\n\n\"Because methane production is a possible signature of biological activity, our result is disappointing for many,\" said study lead author Christopher Webster, an Earth and planetary scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nBut the findings still puzzle scientists.\n\n\"It's a mystery surrounded by an enigma here,\" said imaging physicist Jan-Peter Muller of University College London, who is a Curiosity rover science team member but is not one of the authors of this latest Mars methane study. \"This clearly contradicts what has been measured from space and from Earth.\"\n\nMethane mystery on Mars\n\nThe Curiosity rover has analyzed the surface and atmosphere of Mars with an arsenal of advanced scientific instruments ever since its spectacular landing on Mars in August 2012. Measurements from the rover's Tunable Laser Spectrometer, a device specially designed for measuring the gas on Mars, say the most methane that could currently exist in the Martian atmosphere is 1.3 parts per billion by volume. [Latest Mars Photos by the Curiosity Rover]\n\n\"Based on earlier observations, we were expecting to land on Mars and measure background levels of methane of at least several parts per billion, but saw nothing,\" Webster told SPACE.com.\n\nWhen the researchers first looked for methane using Curiosity, they found strong signals that they quickly realized were coming from the little methane that they had taken with them, Webster said \u2014 that is, \"'Florida air' that had leaked into one chamber during the long prelaunch activities. This contamination has been removed in stages, but each attempt to look for methane from the Mars atmosphere has resulted in a non-detection.\"\n\nThe original plan of the researchers was to analyze the carbon isotope ratios of methane on Mars to get insight on whether that gas could be biologically produced. \"However, the lack of significant methane has denied that latter experiment,\" Webster said.\n\nThis new measurement is about six times lower than previous estimates of methane levels on Mars. Webster and his colleagues suggest this severely limits the odds of methane production by microbes below the surface of Mars or from rock chemistry.\n\n\"It's an excellent piece of science,\" Muller told SPACE.com. \"However, it's not to say that what is measured 1 meter (3 feet) above the ground is representative of the atmosphere in total \u2014 that's a matter of interpretation, not necessarily a matter of fact.\"\n\nIs the methane hiding?\n\nFor instance, past measurements of methane in the atmosphere of Mars analyzed a region much higher above the surface, \"so these might be very different measurements,\" Muller said. \"It does leave a little wiggle room in terms of interpretation.\"\n\nMoreover, when it comes to places on Earth where methane leaks out, scientists can detect large volumes of methane right at the plumes but practically none away from them, Muller said.\n\n\"It's difficult to know whether the null measurement from Curiosity has to do with being in the wrong place at the wrong time, or whether it is representative of Mars,\" Muller said.\n\n\"We are often asked if our measurements at Gale Crater represent the planet as a whole,\" Webster noted. \"We remind others that the lifetime of methane on Mars is very long, about 300 years, compared to the short mixing time \u2014 months \u2014 for the whole atmosphere, so we feel our measurement does represent the global background value.\"\n\nCuriosity experiment may hold the key\n\nThe Sample Analysis at Mars suite of instruments on Curiosity has yet to conduct a \"methane enrichment\" experiment that will increase the sensitivity of the rover's Tunable Laser Spectrometer even further \u2014 by a factor of at least 10, Webster said. \"It's possible that we may then see methane at extremely low levels \u2014 or, alternatively, we will not, and our upper limit will go down much further,\" he added.\n\nThe ExoMars spacecraft, planned for launch in 2016, will study the chemical composition of Mars' atmosphere to learn more about any methane there.\n\n\"It can look at the vertical distribution of methane on Mars, see if it's lofted some way high up in the atmosphere or if it's near the ground,\" Muller said. \"If it's near the ground, that's likely reflective of it seeping out of the ground; if it's high in the atmosphere, some exotic photochemical process may be responsible.\"\n\nWebster stressed that Curiosity will continue its mission to assess the habitability of Mars.\n\n\"The Curiosity rover will continue to make its measurements of both atmosphere and rock samples to discover if organics other than methane exist on Mars,\" Webster said. \"To that end, the jury is still out, as these important measurements are being made in a series of studies that will extend many months into the future.

{"text": "BUFFALO, N.Y. \u2014 With one sweet swing, Edwin Encarnacion showed the Toronto Blue Jays what they hope to be getting back soon.\n\nAfter missing more than a month with a strained right quadriceps muscle, Encarnacion is close to rejoining the Blue Jays in the middle of their playoff chase. Now on a minor-league rehab stint with the triple-A Buffalo Bisons, Encarnacion is one step away, and on Tuesday night he showed evidence of his progress by hitting a first-pitch, no-doubt grand slam.\n\nEncarnacion, who led off as the designated hitter, went 1 for 4 with the grand slam, a fly out, a pop up and a ground out. He reported no problems after the Bisons\u2019 7-5 victory.\n\n\"It\u2019s a lot of fun to be playing and have a game like today,\" Encarnacion said. \"I feel great with my leg, that\u2019s the main thing right now. It feels great: no problems swinging, no problems running.\"\n\nWith the bases loaded in the second inning Encarnacion made short work of a first-pitch slider from Norfolk Tides starter Steve Johnson, showing the right-handed power stroke the Blue Jays could desperately use by smacking the ball over the fence in left.\n\n\"I was just looking for something in the strike zone and make a good swing on it,\" Encarnacion said. \"He handed me the slider and I made a good swing on it.\"\n\nThe plan is for Encarnacion to play two more games with the Bisons before meeting up with the Blue Jays on Friday in Chicago. Despite missing the past month, the 31-year-old still leads the team in home runs (26) and trails only Jose Bautista in runs batted in (70).\n\nAfter suffering a recent setback that delayed his return to the injury-ravaged Blue Jays, the main objective during the final step of Encarnacion\u2019s rehab is to get him to the majors in one piece.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s quite there where he wants to be with his leg there. But we\u2019ll play that by ear,\" manager Gary Allenson said before the game. \"Keeping him healthy through the next couple days is important.\"\n\nWhen Encarnacion was injured in Oakland on July 5, the Blue Jays were half-game back of the Baltimore Orioles in the AL East. Going into Tuesday night\u2019s game at the Seattle Mariners they were six back, making the second wild-card spot their most realistic shot of reaching the playoffs.\n\nEncarnacion has watched every game since going on the disabled list and been in communication with his teammates.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been talking to every guy,\" he said. \"They want to see me there soon.\"\n\nRecently, the Blue Jays have had to try to stay afloat without Encarnacion, first baseman Adam Lind and third baseman Brett Lawrie. Lind (fractured right foot) was activated in time to bat cleanup against the Mariners on Tuesday, while Lawrie (straight left oblique) is out until at least September.\n\nToronto manager John Gibbons said last week his hope was to have Encarnacion and Lind split first-base and designated-hitting duties when they returned, which would allow Juan Francisco and Danny Valencia to platoon at third. Encarnacion wants to be back sooner rather than later, but not at the expense of quality hitting.\n\n\"I just try to be available to play not 100 per cent but close to help my team win games,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t want to go there and play only 50 or 60 per cent because I (wouldn\u2019t) help my team. I want to make sure that I\u2019ll be 100 per cent and be healthy to help my team.\"\n\nAlthough Allenson joked that the slugger might not be the ideal lead-off hitter, Encarnacion was there to maximize his at-bats. He\u2019s expected to play first base Wednesday night, with Thursday afternoon\u2019s game plan still up in the air.\n\nNo matter the plan, outfielder Kevin Pillar, who appeared in 26 games for the Blue Jays this season, doesn\u2019t think it hurts to have Encarnacion in Buffalo\u2019s lineup for a little while.\n\n\"It\u2019s always nice having guys like Eddie come down and if you can just pick his brain for a day or two and just get a chance to watch him hit, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s not going to miss a beat,\" Pillar said. \"Watching a guy like him come into spring training without maybe a whole lot of live pitching and hit the way he does, it\u2019ll just be fun for us and fun for the people of Buffalo to get a chance to see him play.\"\n\nKnowing he\u2019s in charge of a major asset for the parent club, Allenson said a decision to send Encarnacion home from third might be a little more conservative than with other players. Blue Jays GM Alex Anthopoulos said \"explosive movements\" while running were the biggest concern for Encarnacion.\n\n\"I think that\u2019s what he might need to protect,\" Anthopoulos said last week. \"If he\u2019s hitting a chopper down the third-base line and he\u2019s really trying to sprint down the line or he\u2019s trying to stretch an extra-base hit and things like that.\"\n\nPerhaps even more telling than the grand slam was Encarnacion\u2019s grounder that made him test his quadriceps running down the first base line.\n\n\"I feel good,\" he said. \"I feel great and I think everything\u2019s going to be all right.\"\n\nSteps away from being back with the Blue Jays, Encarnacion won\u2019t be expected to push himself too hard the rest of this week as he inches back.\n\n\"If he just goes up when he gets done here, goes up and DHs, that\u2019s a big bat to have in the lineup,\" Allenson said. \"More than anything for Edwin, as long as he gets his timing down, sees some pitches and gets comfortable where he gets it going again it will be just fine.\"", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "5368", "entropy": "4.494565598188247", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4642593957258659", "brevity_score": "0.0020533880903490695"}

NoLIta.\n\nWestoria?\n\nA neighborhood shop owner has coined a new nickname for the slice of Astoria she calls home as a way to promote business in the lightly trafficked area \u2014 and her push is picking up steam.\n\nNatassa Contini, owner of the cafe and pet supply shop Chateau Le Woof on 14th Street and 30th Avenue, started using the name Westoria to refer to the portion of the neighborhood west of 21st Street, between Astoria Park and Broadway. The boundaries closely coincide with the neighborhood more commonly known as \"Old Astoria,\" or \"Old Astoria Village.\"\n\n\"It's just something fun that I started doing,\" explained Contini, who has been using the name in social media posts and even started selling T-shirts emblazoned with the moniker. \"I don\u2019t want to take anything away from Old Astoria.\"\n\nShe began hashtaging #Westoria on Chateau Le Woof's Instagram posts, after having played with similar names like \"West Astoria\" and \"Westside.\" It's a way to draw attention to the stores, restaurants and local landmarks in the area, which has traditionally seen less foot traffic than other parts of Astoria, she explained.\n\n\"Even when the store opened, when I was describing where I am, people would go, 'Oh, I don\u2019t go that way,'\" Contini said. \"No one would cross 21st Street.\"\n\nFresco's Cantina, a Mexican restaurant on 31st Avenue near 12th Street, has also featured Westoria on its social media posts, and the local blog We Heart Astoria used it to describe the area in a post about the same restaurant.\n\nOne of Contini's employees, who runs an apparel company, starting making Westoria shirts, which Contini sells at Chateau Le Woof for $20.\n\nThe shop owner also started an Instagram account, @westoria.life, which she says will be used to highlight local small businesses, events and other happenings.\n\n\"[It's] just promoting the awesome things on the west side that we have that not too many people know about,\" Contini explained.\n\nBut the name has elicited some eyerolls, including a recent debate on a Reddit thread entitled \"Stop Trying to Make 'Westoria' Happen.'\"\n\n\"Is this an actual thing? Can it NOT be a thing???\" the original poster wrote. \"I feel like it's creating unauthentic terms for marketing purposes in order to sell the hype of Astoria as a new trendy neighborhood.\"\n\nAdded another poster: \"What do you expect when a bunch of hipsters keep moving in?\"\n\nHowever, some countered that they think neighborhood sub-names like Westoria make sense, considering how big the neighborhood is.\n\n\"I don't think it's that unreasonable,\" one Reddit poster chimed in. \"Especially now that there's going to be more development around Hallet's Cove, it feels like everything west of 21st street is going to have it's [sic] own sort of neighborhood.\"\n\n\u25ba RELATED: Here Are the Upcoming Projects That Will Transform the Astoria Waterfront\n\nAttempts at new neighborhood nicknames in other parts of the city have been met with backlash before, generally because they were rooted in real estate interests looking to market a particular area \u2014 like brokers latching onto \"SoHa\" when selling apartments in south Harlem.\n\n\u25ba RELATED: SoHa: The New Name Realtors Are Using For a Part of Harlem\n\nBut Contini said that's not her intention.\n\n\"It's not being corporate and mainstream and taking over,\" she said, noting she's simply hoping to help promote \"the local small businesses that work 16 hours a day.\"\n\n\"It's really just identifying ourselves \u2014 coming together,\" she said.\n\nRichard Khuzami, head of the advocacy group Old Astoria Neighborhood Association, said he hasn't really heard \"Westoria\" being used, but doesn't mind it.\n\nFor years, Old Astoria \u2014 the name that's been used to described the area for as long as he can remember \u2014 had been somewhat overlooked, with an outside perception of being on \"the other side of the tracks.\"\n\n\"The area west of 21st Street was separated from the rest of the community,\" he said.\n\n\u25ba RELATED: Hallets Point Will Revitalize Astoria's 'Locked' Waterfront, Officials Say\n\nThat's changing even more now as the neighborhood is getting more attention, especially with the opening of the new ferry dock at Hallets Point, he noted.\n\n\"I'm glad that people at least are taking part in where they live, regardless of the name,\" he said. \"That shows that they're proud to be from this area.\"", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "4481", "entropy": "4.58499162563648", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4876748834110593", "brevity_score": "0.002304147465437774"}

Mikulski, Maryland Democrat, who challenged women to push the fight. \u201cPut on your lipstick, square your shoulders and let\u2019s fight for this new American revolution where women are paid equal pay for equal work.\u201d\n\nThe legislation, known as the Paycheck Fairness Act, would shift burdens of proof toward businesses to defend their pay decisions, and would give women the right to sue for compensatory and punitive damages. It would allow women to file a class-action suit and would make them specifically have to opt out of the class.\n\nIn addition, the bill would prevent companies from retaliating against employees who share their own pay information.\n\nRepublicans said the vote was about politics, not policy, and girded for more attacks by Democrats who argue that Republicans have repeatedly voted this year against women\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cThe only winners under this legislation would be trial lawyers,\u201d said Sen. Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican who has written a different bill that he said would get at the problem by focusing on information rather than lawsuits.\n\nHe said his legislation would protect those seeking pay information that could help them determine whether discrimination is going on \u2014 including protections for whistleblowers. His bill was just introduced this week and was not voted on.\n\nPresident Obama, who has endorsed the Paycheck Fairness Act, called Tuesday\u2019s vote \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d and said equal pay should be a key part of economic recovery plans.\n\nOn the other side, business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are opposing the bill, and warned they would consider Tuesday\u2019s vote when grading lawmakers this year.\n\nThe bill had the support of all 53 Democrats, though the final vote was 52-47 after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid switched his vote to \u201cno\u201d \u2014 a common parliamentary procedure that gives Mr. Reid the power to ask for a revote in the future.\n\nOne of those voting for it was Sen. Ben Nelson, Nebraska Democrat, who switched his vote from 2010 \u2014 the last time the bill came up \u2014 when he voted with the GOP to block it.\n\n\u201cThank you, Ben,\u201d Sen. Barbara Boxer, California Democrat, called out after him as he voted and left the floor.\n\nA half-dozen women from the House came to the Senate to watch the vote, led by Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, who is sponsoring a companion bill on the House side.\n\nBut that legislation is unlikely to see daylight in that chamber, which is controlled by the Republicans and which was likely to block the Senate bill even if it had cleared the upper chamber Tuesday.\n\nNo Senate Republicans voted for the legislation, though Mitt Romney, the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, still hasn\u2019t taken a stand on it.\n\nThat\u2019s opened the former Massachusetts governor to attacks from Democrats who say he could sway his party\u2019s lawmakers if he would get involved in the debate.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 An internal watchdog at the Department of Veterans Affairs released findings this week confirming what many veterans and lawmakers already knew: the $10 billion V WASHINGTON \u2014 An internal watchdog at the Department of Veterans Affairs released findings this week confirming what many veterans and lawmakers already knew: the $10 billion V eterans Choice Program created to give veterans access to private health care has been \u201ccumbersome\u201d and \u201cconfusing\u201d to use.\n\nThe program was established by Congress in 2014, following discoveries veterans were suffering with long waits for care at VA facilities. The nominee for VA Secretary, David Shulkin, who worked as the VA\u2019s undersecretary of health, was responsible for implementing it. Because of his involvement, the report \u2013 and the program\u2019s deficiencies, in general \u2013 was questioned Wednesday during Shulkin\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing.\n\nShulkin reiterated to senators that the VA inspector general reviewed only the start of the program, from November 2014 through September 2015, and it has since improved. Inspectors noted Congress gave the VA only 90 days to establish the program \u2013 a timeline that \u201cposed many challenges.\u201d\n\nADVERTISING ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads\n\n\u201c[I]t described, I think accurately, a program that was in disarray,\u201d Shulkin said of the report. \u201cWe\u2019ve made this a much, much different program than it was then, and you can see the results.\u201d\n\ngallery\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs nominee Dr. David Shulkin, right, shakes hands with Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs Ranking Member Sen.

Jon Tester, D-Mont, before Shulkin's confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill, Feb. 1, 2017.\n\nThe VA used nearly $165 million to implement the program during its first year, while spending only $16 million on medical care during the same time, the report states. In many cases, veterans were sent back to the VA after waiting 48 days, on average, to get an appointment with a doctor in the private sector. About 98,200 veterans who were still holding out for an appointment in the private sector as of September 2015 were waiting an average of 72 days to be scheduled.\n\nThrough the Veterans Choice Program, a third-party administrator was responsible for scheduling appointments for veterans for private-sector care.\n\n\u201c[T]he procedures used to authorize and schedule appointments under Choice\u2026 were cumbersome and required veterans to schedule their treatment without assistance from [the VA],\u201d inspectors wrote. \u201cThese procedures placed a greater burden on veterans than seeking treatment at [VA] facilities.\u201d\n\nInspectors gave a few examples of how the system led to errors. In one case, the third party scheduled a primary care appointment in New York for a veteran living in Idaho. One veteran in Florida was given an appointment with a specialist in California. Another veteran in south Texas was scheduled with a specialist who couldn\u2019t perform the surgery that he needed.\n\narticle continues below \uf107 article continues below\n\nSpending on medical care has improved since then, the report states. Shulkin testified Wednesday that administrative costs are down to about 10 percent of overall costs associated with the program, which he said is \u201cnot bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the Choice program got stood up, when we were just enrolling patients, the administrative costs were astronomical because we were building a brand new administrative infrastructure,\u201d Shulkin said.\n\nLatest data from the VA shows 32 percent of appointments made by veterans were sent to outside providers in fiscal 2016, up from 23 percent that were sent to the private sector in fiscal 2015.\n\nThe Veterans Choice Program is likely to face more examination this congressional session. The program, meant to be only temporary, is set to expire in August, and lawmakers are trying to devise a system to replace it.\n\nThere have been several proposals for how the VA should manage private-sector care.\n\nPresident Barack Obama established the Commission on Care to draft a proposal, and former VA Secretary Bob McDonald released his own plan. Conservative-leaning veterans group Concerned Veterans for America recently released a proposal for radical change for how private-sector care is managed, and President Donald Trump has said he wants all veterans to have access to the private market.\n\nShulkin described a plan Wednesday to allow veterans to access private-sector doctors for urgent care. Eligibility is now based on veterans\u2019 distance from a VA facility and how long they\u2019ve been waiting for appointments with the VA.\n\nRep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., chairman of the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, said his committee will discuss the Veterans Choice Program during a hearing Feb. 15.", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "5005", "entropy": "4.620046077566276", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4255570893314928", "brevity_score": "0.0025906735751295325"}
{"text": "\u201cNo one is targeting artists because of their politics\u201d. That\u2019s a line that i\u2019ve heard a lot from the social justice circles every time an artist is censored, or is attacked so much that they self-censor. It\u2019s a line i\u2019ve read several times in the last week directed at me, when i have commented in social media about some new attack upon myself. I think my experiences over this last week are a clear example on how, yes, artists are being targeted because of their politics, everytime those politics diverge from the progressive ideology.\n\nI\u2019ve always been an artist who does adult content. My hentai creations have been placed on the internet for more than a decade, and i\u2019ve never had any problems because of it. Yeah, sometimes i got a drawing banned from deviantart, but they were very sporadic things, and usualy deserved; one every 2-3 years at most. No one ever wrote anything about what a horrible person i was for doing erotic fanarts and such.\n\nSince i publicy became a gamergate supporter, the ammount of reports i\u2019ve gotten on art sites have increased, many times in very underserved cases (i got a drawing pulled because the characters had sweat. Yes, sweat\u2026) as well as the amount of people lying about me on blogs and such. And i don\u2019t mean making critiques of me, i mean outright lies (one guy even wrote about how i voted for some candidate in the past US elections, which is interesting considering i\u2019m a spaniard living in Spain). Not only that, but my website began to have attemps to break in. At some point i was receiving more than 50 attempts to break in each day, until i upgraded my security.\n\nBut this broke into a new level when i was announced as a finalist for best Fan artist at the Hugo awards. Then people in the social justice circles discovered that i support gamergate, and since then, interesting things have been happening one after the other (aside from the wave of verbal attacks, of course).\n\nFirst one of my gamergate related works got reported and banned from deviantart. Then someone picked a cheap fanart that i was commissioned to do, about a half nude Ms.marvel, and tried to frame me as a pedophile, because aparently the character has 16 in the original canon (something i even didn\u2019t know), ignoring the fact that the character body was adult. This story was writen about in (as far as i know) a blog and then in a comic news article, expanding the idea that i\u2019m a pedophile for an anime style fanart thats no different than the millions upon millions of anime character fanarts out there, and that i was somehow a terrible threat for teenagers out there who have their heroes destroyed by evil me. I was reported in devianart for \u201cpedophilia\u201d and the drawing was taken down. I got reported on twitter. The attemps to break into my website have come arround again. Then they contacted my advertising affiliates, telling them i was hosting child pornography, so they would cease to advertise with me. They acepted a middle ground solution at first, but then they changed their policies, and now i can no longer receive their service. Yes, and advertising website changed their policies just because of me\u2026 and just yesteday some guys where trying to get MARVEL to SUE ME because of a fanart!\n\nBut hey, i\u2019m sure all of this is just a coincidence! this has nothing to do with the Hugo awards or gamergate. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just that a whole lot of people randomly decided the same week to try to fuck me up in every way they could, right? this can\u2019t possibly be related with people from a particular ideology, pissed off because someone with the wrong opinions got a Hugo nomination.\n\nLet\u2019s not be cynics here. It\u2019s clear as the day that everything that has happened to me this week has been political. If it wasn\u2019t the ms.marvel image, it would have been anything else. They would have attacked me because of some character of my comics or some shit. Maybe because my main character for comics is a black woman, but she\u2019s not represented in the way they like, or because she\u2019s a lesbian and they would call me a homophobe with some stupid excuse. It would have been whatever they could come up to, because in the end this is happening because i have a Hugo nomination and i\u2019m openly against the progressive, social justice, crybully, perpetualy ofended ideology this people have.\n\nSo yes, artists are being targeted because of politics. Specificaly we are being targeted for not being \u201cprogressive enough\u201d, by people who feel that anything is justified if it\u2019s for their \u201ccause\u201d, people who feel they are so moraly superior that they can go to sleep peacefuly after trying to destroy someones career just because they have a different opinion on social topics. You can ask plebcomics about how she had to left her job after being attacked for making comics about Tumblr, ask Frank Cho about the attacks he receives just for doing sexy poses, ask Tarol hunt how feminists tried to ruin him just because they didn\u2019t liked how he portrayed a rape victim in his comic. The list goes on. You can try to dismiss it with lines like \u201cno one is targeting artists\u201d or \u201cthere\u2019s not a regressive left conspiracy\u201d to make it sound unrealistic, but it\u2019s a fact that there is a group of people who goes out of their way to punish artists for their ideologies.\n\nUnfortunately for you, i will keep doing this stuff, now more than ever, and the more you try to take me down, they more i\u2019ll do. Doing this only helps to make me more disgusted of social justice and how it\u2019s advocates operate.", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "5520", "entropy": "4.336052549831601", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.450017850767583", "brevity_score": "0.002092050209205037"}

To extend previous research that relies primarily on the self-report method to assess parent-child interaction, we conducted a longitudinal, mixed-methods study. In a laboratory setting, three major aspects of interaction (i.e., affectivity, cohesiveness, and parental behavior) were observed in 241 parent-child dyads (Children: 43 percent female, age range = 8-15, M age = 12.09, SD age = 1.41; Parents: 78 percent female, age range = 27-63, M age = 44.44, SD age = 6.09). In addition, both parent and children participants completed questionnaires that measured children\u2019s symptoms of Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and exposure to violent video games at baseline (Time 1) and 12 months later (Time 2). The results revealed that at Time 1, positive affectivity and cohesiveness were inversely associated with child-report symptoms of IGD. Also, Time 1 coerciveness (i.e., control dimension of parental behavior) was positively associated with Time 1 child-report exposure to violent video games and Time 2 child-report symptoms of IGD, respectively. Apart from main effects, the results also showed that Time 1 negative affectivity moderated the protective effects of Time 1 positive affectivity on Time 1 parent-report and Time 2 child-report exposure to violent video games, respectively. Overall, this study identifies various key aspects of parent-child interaction that may serve as concurrent or temporal predictors of video gaming-related issues.\n\nKEYWORDS: Internet gaming disorder; behavioral observation; gaming addiction; parent-child interaction; violent video games\n\nPMID: 29792518\n\nDOI:10.1089/cyber.2017.0566", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "1971", "entropy": "4.735470784736283", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4749113025848961", "brevity_score": "0.005586592178770941"}
{"text": "Ms. Gungen\u2019s anxiety rises and falls with the frequency of the clashes between the government and the guerrillas, known as the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K.\n\nFighting has increased since June, rising to a pitch recently when a particularly deadly militant attack led the government to send thousands of soldiers to hunt down the fighters. Ms. Gungen pictures her daughter in danger \u2014 and alone. In late September, she watched in horror as the P.K.K.\u2019s Denmark-based TV channel broadcast news that her daughter\u2019s friend Heybet had been killed during a firefight with Turkish soldiers near the Iraq border, just an hour from home. She was 15.\n\n\u201cIt was like I lost my own daughter that day, too,\u201d Ms. Gungen said. \u201cThey were always together.\u201d\n\nTurkey and its Kurdish citizens have a long and acrimonious history. For decades, the central government, bent on a strict assimilation policy, cracked down on Kurds for expressions of their cultural identity, such as reading publications in Kurdish or listening to Kurdish music. That set the stage for an armed uprising that began in 1984, when the P.K.K. effectively declared war on the state.\n\nSince then, more than 40,000 people have been killed in a series of militant attacks and government reprisals that drove hundreds of thousands of Kurds from rural villages. Turkey, the United States and the European Union designated the P.K.K. a terrorist group.\n\nIn recent years, the government \u2014 in an attempt to join the European Union \u2014 has made some concessions to the Kurds, but promised constitutional changes have yet to be made, and many people remain wary.\n\nThe struggle for Kurdish rights has been emotionally messy. Many in the Kurdish southeast are partisans of the P.K.K.; others remain sympathetic to the group and its ambitions but are, at the same time, weary of war and eager for a peaceful resolution.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFamilies find themselves similarly torn, especially since military service is mandatory for Turkish young men, including Kurds. The young men who feel the most passionate about the rebels run away to join them. Those who disagree with their methods, or are unwilling to live their lives as fugitives, are forced to take up arms for a country from which many feel deeply excluded \u2014 and sometimes to take up arms against those they know, or love.\n\nSome Kurdish nationalists and analysts claim that the government has chosen in recent years to deploy more Kurdish conscripts in their home region, where they are more likely to fight the P.K.K., in an attempt to prove the rebels are cold killers and to gain Kurds\u2019 support.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIn the past, posting Kurdish soldiers to the east was considered to be unsafe by the army because of the lack of trust in the minority,\u201d said Mithat Sancar, professor of law at Ankara University. \u201cHowever, recently it has become almost intentional that young Kurds would be at the forefronts of the battle against the P.K.K., sending the message that the group also killed their own youth.\u201d\n\nThe notoriously tight-lipped Turkish military has refused to address the claims. But Taubet Gungen, 45, who lost her daughter, Heybet, needs no confirmation. \u201cThe state brings our children face to face, and makes brothers kill each other,\u201d she said.\n\nSince the day her daughter died, she has forbidden her seven other children to speak about it, afraid that the pain would overcome her.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

They still seem shocked, even as they describe the girls\u2019 childhoods in which bitterness was a constant.\n\nEmine, the more political of the two girls, knew well the family history; four uncles served jail time for what her mother describes as \u201cdefending their rights.\u201d\n\nHer mother, Mevlude, says she feels the government knows what changes could bring peace, but the slow pace of change makes her worry leaders are \u201cignoring the issues on purpose.\u201d\n\nShe often watches the P.K.K. channel, beamed into the country via satellite because its transmissions are banned in Turkey. The channel includes a steady diet of news of the mistreatment of Kurds in Turkey and includes tributes to P.K.K. \u201cmartyrs\u201d who die in battle, which is how Mevlude learned of the death of her daughter\u2019s friend.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLike many children in this mountain town, Emine participated in antigovernment protests from a young age and even took part in her first daylong hunger strike to support prisoners\u2019 rights when she was just 8.\n\n\u201cLike any mother, I would say to her, \u2018Please eat, you will get sick,\u2019 \u201d Mevlude Gungen said. \u201cBut she would say \u2018No, I will do what everyone else is doing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHere in Sirnak, residents say that the number of young people heading out to the mountains that surround the city to join the militants has grown in recent months as clashes between the guerrillas and the army have intensified.\n\nAccording to figures collected by the International Crisis Group, which studies conflict worldwide, 111 members of the security forces have been killed since June, as have 31 civilians and at least 80 P.K.K. fighters.\n\nThis month, P.K.K. fighters killed 24 Turkish soldiers and wounded 18 more in a complex attack. In response, the Turkish military sent more than 10,000 troops backed by surveillance drones, helicopters and fighter jets into the southern province of Hakkari, just 90 miles from here, and across the border into Iraq. The operation has killed at least 270 militants and wounded more than 210, Turkey\u2019s top military commander, Gen. Necdet Ozel, told the news channel NTV last week.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s children are going to the mountains, not only ours,\u201d said Taubet Gungen. \u201cThere are thousands of mothers whose children are in the mountains. We are used to it, the same way our sons go away to the army.\u201d\n\nIf their other children choose to join the P.K.K., neither woman thinks they could stop them; the children would just run away like Emine and Heybet, they say.\n\n\u201cI want peace for both sides,\u201d Emine\u2019s mother said. \u201cThe men in the army are our children, but so are the ones in the mountains.

Family Tradition, which opened in March 2008, is the largest and most popular temporary exhibition in the institution's history. The exhibit, which includes Hank Williams' notebooks and other memorabilia, will close on Dec. 31.\n\nThe project began with the idea of finding a well-known artist, one who felt Williams' inspiration and influence, to record an album's worth of the unheard songs. After veteran music industry manager/A&R executive Mary Martin approached Dylan, a natural first choice for the endeavor, the project evolved into a multi-artist tribute providing a variety of sympathetic approaches to the material.\n\nSongs are:\n\n1.

Mitik survived the flooding of his enclosure and is ready for the aquarium to reopen on May 25. (Seth Wenig/Associated Press)\n\nThe New York Aquarium\u2019s spot by the sea for the last 50 years has helped make it a special attraction, but last fall that location almost destroyed it.\n\nWater from Hurricane Sandy flooded the aquarium\u2019s carefully managed tanks with oily, dirty water. Power to the exhibits was knocked out, making it impossible for aquarium staff to check on the 12,000 animals for days. There was even talk of shipping the animals away.\n\nBut the happy ending to this story is that six months after the storm, more than 80 percent of aquarium\u2019s collection remains intact, and visitors should be able to see walruses, angelfish, otters and other animals when about half the aquarium reopens May 25. There are also plans to expand and floodproof the aquarium, which is on Coney Island next to the Cyclone roller coaster.\n\nAs aquarium director Jon Forrest Dohlin walked through the 14-acre grounds recently, penguins watched from their outdoor habitat. Walruses snoozed as sea lions arced through the air on their trainers\u2019 cues, staying in practice for when shows resume. Angelfish and other tropical species shimmered around a coral reef.\n\nBut the effects of the October 29 storm were still clearly visible.\n\nYou can see the sea lion\u2019s reflection in a puddle of water on the floor of an exhibit that was flooded to the ceiling during Hurricane Sandy at the New York Aquarium. (Seth Wenig/Associated Press)\n\nFor example, the open pool in the front of the aquarium was dry; it had housed hundreds of freshwater koi that died in the saltwater surge.\n\nSharks, sea turtles and rays swam in a tank in the aquarium\u2019s veterinary hospital. They\u2019re healthy but were put there after the storm destroyed their exhibit.\n\nUp to 15 feet of water swamped basements during Sandy. The pump house, which makes sure that the oxygen levels, temperature and water chemistry are right for the animals in each exhibit, wasn\u2019t working.\n\nNone of the animals had been evacuated from the area. That would have been very difficult to arrange in the few days the aquarium had to prepare, Dohlin said.\n\nScrambling to save the animals, 18 staffers used hospital-style canisters to get oxygen into the water, rebuilt filters and pumps on the fly and called in equipment from four zoos. They mixed artificial seawater in garbage cans and warmed rooms with space heaters to keep water temperatures up.\n\nAt the same time, managers had to decide how much longer they could wait before sending the animals away, which could have been harmful to the already stressed creatures. But by November 3, key systems were at least partially running in all the exhibits, so the animals stayed.\n\nThe koi and some other fish had died. But many other fish and all the mammals were fine \u2014 including Mitik, an orphaned walrus calf that arrived only weeks before. He seemed to enjoy splashing in a couple of feet of surge water, Dohlin said.\n\nA three-foot-long American eel disappeared from its tank but turned up, unharmed, in a shower stall.

{"text": "World Greenhouse Gas Levels Increase at Fastest Rate in 30 Years\n\nBetween 2012 and 2013, carbon dioxide emissions were higher than in any other year since 1984, the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) has said in its latest report (pdf) this week.\n\nThe WMO\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin shows there has been an atmospheric CO2 increase of 2.9 parts per million during that period, which is the biggest increase in 3 decades. The total concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rose to 396 parts per million. This is 142% of what CO2 concentrations were back before the industrial revolution. In other words, they have mostly been caused by human activity, chiefly the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nWorld Meteorological Organisation Secretary General Michel Jarraud has urged that, \u201cWe must reverse this trend by cutting emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases across the board. We are running out of time.\u201d He added, \u201cWe know without any doubt that our climate is changing and our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nIt is known that CO2 stays in the atmosphere and oceans for hundreds of years, so all the extra CO2 human activities have been emitting has been having a cumulative effect on both global warming and ocean acidification. Carbon dioxide is responsible for four-fifths of the increase in global warming from greenhouse gases.\n\nAt this rate, the 400 parts per million mark will be reached as early as 2015 or 2016, although it has already been reached for short periods. CO2 levels tend to fluctuate somewhat between regions and seasons, but the alarming upward trend is very clear.\n\nThe WMO says action needs to be taken to cut the amount of CO2 going into the atmosphere to prevent disastrous climate change. Policymakers worldwide are being urged to use the report as a clear \u201cscientific base for decision-making\u201d. By all accounts, the correct decisions need to be made as soon as possible.\n\nImage CC licensed by placid casual: Coal-fired power plant\n\nVia Think Progress, Guardian", "type": "openwebtext", "length": "2058", "entropy": "4.523152348430254", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.5212150433944069", "brevity_score": "0.004524886877828041"}

{"text": "Gene. 3:22 Then the Lord God said, \u201cBehold the man has become as one of us, knowing good and evil, and now lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever \u2026.\u201d\nFrom this verse, we can conclude that the humans were not immortal, even in the garden of Eden, before eating of the forbidden fruit. See the discussion of the next verse. Also notice the use of the first person plural pronoun, us. Is God speaking to the angels again? [Return to Gene. 11:6]\nGene. 3:23 So the Lord God took him from the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken.\nEither we have another problem here, or we need to look more closely at what is happening, in order to understand the implications of these few passages. In v. 3:17 God tells the man that he shall have to toil to eat the produce of the ground. But it isn\u2019t until v. 3:22 that God \u201cthinks\u201d to remove him from Eden. Before this, was the man to have lived out his curse in Eden? Might this tell us something new of Eden? Verse 3:22 implies that the man and woman would not live forever until they ate of the tree of life. Therefore, our view of Eden as the place of eternal life may be erroneous. Adam and Eve did not lose life eternal when they were banished. They never had it. Their lifetimes were also limited in Eden.\nHowever, once again we must question our view of the scribe\u2019s apparent description of God\u2019s actions. Would God have cursed Adam and Eve without already \u201cknowing\u201d that they were to be banished? I believe that v. 3:22 is simply the scribe\u2019s way of explaining the historical events as he understood them. He, as many of the bible scribes after him do, attributes human-like qualities to God. Could the supreme Ruler of the universe, the Creator of everything, be like a human? Yet throughout the bible He is depicted as possessing the attributes of humans. At the same time, and often by the same scribes who depict God with human traits, God is greatly exalted, as being so far above humans as heaven is above earth, for example. Is it appropriate for us to imagine God being like a human? Like a BIG Man? I earnestly refuse to accept this depiction. I think it is inappropriate for us to try to describe God, period. We don\u2019t possess the capacity. To try would be like trying to make God less holy. However, God does inform us of His attributes: Holy, infinitely patient and merciful, everlasting, ever faithful and caring, all-knowing, vigilant, possessive of His people, ....", "type": "oscar", "length": "2492", "entropy": "4.430555337792024", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.5063593004769475", "brevity_score": "0.0037174721189590955"}

While this kit may feature Dragons fine detail their were a few faults with its construction.\nOne of the first faults I found was the attachment points for the rear tow point. To attache correctly they would sit at an incorrect angle, so I glued them at the correct angle and filled the gap. There was also a major gap to fill on the rear of the engine deck due to poor fit. The alignment of the upper and lower hulls was far from clean but as the fender/track guards connected and covered along the same line no additional work was needed.\nThe join between the upper and lower turret was far from clean which required a lot sanding to get a smooth join, this in turn created another problem of removing the surface cast turret texture. I solved this bu using Tamiya's orange lid cement, painting it on with the supplied brush in moderate size areas, waiting 30-40 seconds till the plastic get tacky then spearing the end of the brush onto the turret dappling and recreating well the original cast texture.\nThe photo I was using for inspiration on this build had a tank whose skirting had slight peeled back damage which I replicated on this build by first gently cutting the part in two then lightly softening the plastic with a candle and folding it back.

{"text": "Dogs don\u2019t always show pain. Something obvious like a broken leg or a bad sprain will show, but the dull ache of osteoarthritis may not be noticed, especially during the initial stages.\nThis, of course, makes your job of detection a little more challenging. Instead of looking for yelping or crying, detection of pain involves studying changes in your dog\u2019s behaviour. Is he avoiding activities that he used to do easily in the past \u2014 jumping down from the couch, climbing down stairs? Or does he lag during the last part of his walk?\nPain doesn\u2019t do your dog any good at all. It makes his favourite activities such as a walk or a game of ball less enjoyable for him. If he has been diagnosed with osteoarthritis, good pain control will make a big difference to his quality of life.\nIf you think your dog may be suffering from arthritis, talk to your vet. A vet is the only person who can diagnose arthritis, and prescribe medication to manage the condition. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually the first choice of pain medications for osteoarthritis.\nYou should never give human drugs to your dog, and in fact don\u2019t give him any medication except under medical supervision. There could be serious side effects, including death, if the wrong medication or an incorrect dose is used.\nAlthough it\u2019s better to act before arthritis becomes a problem, canine arthritis treatment is still a great option for dogs that already have it. Arthritis isn\u2019t curable but can be managed effectively using treatments that focus on reducing pain and inflammation, slowing the progression of the disease, facilitating the repair of damaged tissues and maintaining or improving joint function.\nIf your vet prescribes an NSAID for your dog, you may want to ask your vet about using a nutritional joint supplement, such as Supleneo Flex in addition to using the prescribed NSAID.\nWhile pain relief has been shown that in some instances it can help recovery, if your dog over-extends himself the opposite can be true. Regular controlled exercise is the best option for optimum long-term recovery and management.\nAnother thing to watch for is side effects. All drugs have them, but if you give your dog his medication according to your vet\u2019s directions, the risks are very small. If he is taking long-term medication, you can expect your vet to recommend regular blood tests just to make sure everything is okay on the inside.", "type": "oscar", "length": "2426", "entropy": "4.370744382831113", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.5053235053235053", "brevity_score": "0.003952569169960477"}

{"text": "Unbalanced is powered by Vocal creators. You support Marcus Azaria by reading, sharing and tipping stories... more\nThere are a few things you can begin doing today that will increase your productivity in a sport. Just so you know, I'm not just anybody, I have won three provincial championships in two different sports here in Canada. Taking the step to becoming a top athlete is a combination of many things, but a few things to consider include mentality, diet, practice, and training.\nThe two sports I was in were baseball and basketball. My first year I was cut from the AAA team, and then from the AA team in baseball. Playing on the A team, I was the starting pitcher and led my team to the status of provincial champions in A ball. My next year in baseball I played AA where I was also a starting pitcher/shortstop\u2014I was one of the last cuts from the AAA team. But let me tell you what I did to get there. I would go down in my basement and throw the ball against the cement wall, sometimes for an hour at a time or more. I would blast music and continue to keep going. Catching ground balls over and over again. It will build arm strength and increase your ability to field a ground ball. But this does not limit to just baseball, you could do it with tennis, hockey, and many other sports.\nSo practice will get you better at the sport, but you need to search for the right teachers and the right drills to practice as well. I spent countless hours in the gym shooting basketballs, I would go home and do dribbling drills in my basement, and I'd lay on the floor and shoot the basketball straight up into the air. Trying to catch it perfectly and building muscle memory, so when a fan yells mid-shot my body knows what to do.\nIt starts with footwork. Your body will follow the feet and change the way your upper body is working and the motion it takes. I also won two provincial championships in basketball at the highest level. We had great teams and all of us were very talented. Your team is only as good as it's worst player. The best comes to you when you put the time into practicing and training. This feeds off your diet. Feed the athlete in you. Eat high protein meals to build muscle, and stay away from fast food and soft drinks. If you want to reach the next level combine all of these and a mindset with the confidence you will be the best.\nIt is important to remember once school is finished, you still have chances to excel. You will get better and you will have more time to practice and train too. You want to workout the entire body: Run, bike free weights, row, bench press. For basketball I did some plyometric jump training for a summer; I could get my entire head above the rim. For this, I did lunges, skipped 200 times, squatted, jumped 20 times straight in a row, and then backwards. I jumped around in a square clockwise and counterclockwise. You will need to eat a lot more food, as not to crash mid-season. Rest is important too, your body needs enough rest so you can go 100 percent in your next session\u2014better than 90 percent body function.\nSo search videos, search training, and you can get to the top even though you may not be there yet. Maybe you were cut; that's good, fall forward, get back up, and get in the gym. You can make the team next year, or get on a summer team.\nConstantly searching for additional income sources.Millennial, 3 time provincial sports champion(basketball,baseball)\nThe women's evolution or \"revolution\" started like this amazing roller coaster ride.

It was developed at the end of the 19th century when Amsterdam was experiencing a 2nd golden age.\nLabyrinth Cocktail Food and Poetry Bar is a place where poetry provides a jumping off point, getting diverse groups of people to share ideas, thoughts, and emotions. Amsterdam is home to 179 different nationalities and it\u2019s with the idea of connecting these various nationalities that Sam Kingue Ebelle, started his business. Labyrinth was closed just recently, undergoing a sharp revamp. Gone are the bright lights and walls, the bar is now a darker soul and a more African style gives the bar an intimate feel, or as the locals would say it, gezellig.\nThe Kitchen is inspired by African Caribbean and American ingredients, offering a range of bites to share such as marinated fava beans with sundried tomatoes and ginger \u20ac7.50, Stewed Okra in tomato sauce with Cajun Spices, Coriander, Lemon and Bread \u20ac7,50 and Southern Fried Chicken with hot BBQ sauce \u20ac10,50. The special menu of the day (from \u20ac14,50) is displayed on a blackboard.\nFamed far and wide for our extensive cocktail menu, each drink has a poetic spin. Timeless Mystery - if you decide to drink, chose one of the most delicious gins, then drink slowly and enjoy. As you\u2019re drinking, bear in mind that in each drop, are 300 years of history and 11 generations of craft workers. Sam The Man - \u20ac12 onwards. Originally from Cameroon in Central African, Sam was raised in Paris and has been living in Amsterdam for the past 25 years making him a truly local-global figure. He started studying economics, but now working in the hospitality trade he is a qualified mixologist with a wealth of experience. He has managed cocktails bars in the center of Amsterdam including the trendy Pijp and has won several international Bar Tending and Best Bar of Amsterdam Awards. Sam\u2019s passion lies in creating amazing and unusual beverages finding the right balance in each drink. As a true entrepreneur he works full-time and that means 6 days a week!\nThe job brings new challenges daily and the learning curve is perpendicular but the process of finding creative solutions has given him an agile and strong mind. It\u2019s a labor of love, dedicated to the art of hospitality and business and a tough business too, but they seem to be making all the right moves.\nWith an impressive list of events ranging from weekly, monthly and every six weeks, Monday evening\u2019s Open Mic nights including poetry, spoken word, and singer-songwriters, all in combination with music. From the last Saturday of the month Labyrinth Cocktail, Food & Poetry Bar to the 6 weekly Sunday evenings Jazz bands and poetry readings, the artists are mostly local-global or trans locals presenting to a live audience of the same kind.\nWhen Labyrinth Cocktail, Food and Poetry Bar is in full swing, full of people sharing, eating and connecting is when the magic sets in \u2013 this is what gives them their buzz, what gives them energy and drives them to keep going.

Adolescence is the most dynamic time in a person\u2019s life, with the most profound change that occurs in mental, physical, and social aspects. It\u2019s also the time when teens begin to view and understand themselves with relation to the world, beginning to form their sense of individuality and identity. As such, many different important aspects of personality and identity are formed during adolescence, including things such as hobbies, beliefs, practices, and skills. This process of self-reflection and discovery can be challenging for many teens, especially when teens are struggling with mental health and/or substance abuse conditions. In order to protect and nurture this important development while teens are in treatment, at Paradigm Treatment Centers we incorporate aspects of Identity Formation into all of our treatment plans.\nIdentity is usually formed through a combination of factors, including things such as how teens view themselves, the communities and experiences they are a part of, and external factors that are out of teens\u2019 control. In this sense, it\u2019s important to recognize that when teens are struggling with confidence and/or sense of self, this can be due to a variety of reasons. The concept of identity development as a stage of psycho-social development dates back to the 1960s, when Erik Erikson, a psychologist, focused his work on how teens unconsciously and consciously make decisions as an attempt to fulfill themselves, and how this fulfillment or lack thereof leads to either a strong or weakened identity, respectively.\nSome of the central environments that affect identity are teens\u2019 schools, peers, and family, which contributes to how teens view themselves and how confident they are. Other aspects of identity which teens can\u2019t control include social identity related to how teens are perceived by others. For many teens, this can be a challenge during high school, when teens can be especially harsh in their judgements of each other. Virtually all of these factors of identity are often challenges for teens struggling with mental health and/or substance abuse disorders. Teens struggling with these conditions often suffer from low feelings of self-worth, as well as false belief systems that causes them to view themselves negatively and inaccurately. Over time, these prolonged negative feelings can disrupt teens\u2019 healthy development of identity. Moreover, it\u2019s also common for teens to experience tension in relationships, which can further the negative false beliefs teens are currently holding about themselves. Because of the ways in which these symptoms can contribute to teens\u2019 ability to healthily engage in identity development, we evaluate and incorporate these aspects into all of our treatment plans at Paradigm Treatment Centers.\nAt Paradigm Treatment Centers, we approach all of our teen treatment plans individually and holistically, with the goal of supporting all aspects of teens\u2019 overall health and well-being. Teens receive individual therapy sessions every day during treatment, which allows us to be precise and consistent in ensuring teens\u2019 deepest core needs are recognized and addressed. In talk therapy sessions, our therapists work with teens to help them evaluate and process important aspects of their current experiences and how they relate to identity. In both individual and group therapy sessions, our therapists help teens to rebuild healthy belief systems and practices, which will enable them to regain confidence and to see themselves clearly and positively. At Paradigm Treatment Centers, we also incorporate numerous different positive activities and interests for teens, which will contribute to their overall quality of life as well new healthy ways to spend time. In this way, as we work with teens to do the important therapeutic work of healing and recovery, we also help teens to learn to value themselves and their lives again.", "type": "oscar", "length": "5223", "entropy": "4.338252960842692", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.40845875404839016", "brevity_score": "0.002631578947368431"}
{"text": "From time to time, horrifying images from the Holocaust death camps pass before my eyes, prompting me to consider the magnitude of the unfathomable cruelty inflicted on an entire race of living, breathing people\u2026 grandparents, children\u2026 young people\u2026 newlyweds\u2026 babies.\nIf I consider that moment in history long enough, it sucks the oxygen right from me. I don\u2019t have the cruelty gene in me. I am unable to force my brain to even go there. I am intrinsically unable to inflict pain or violence on a completely innocent person. Sometimes as I consider what some humans have done to other humans, I seriously wonder if I\u2019m simply not of the same species. Or maybe they\u2019re not.\nI was not yet born during World War II, so all of the images and stories from it are in shaded gray photographs and film clips\u2026 something that, while growing up, was a thing that happened a long time ago and shall never happen again. And of course, I grew up, and discovered that bigotry, racism and cruelty continue to flow through the collective psyche of our pathetically flawed species like a current of toxic waste.\nI was watching some documentary awhile back, forget which one exactly, in which there was a video clip scanning past a group of starving, suffering Jewish women in a concentration camp\u2026 their eyes, pleading and pain-stricken\u2026 wrenching to look at. But not as painful as the eyes that held nothing at all anymore. Just dull resignation, like candle wicks gone cold. If you don\u2019t convulse in compassion when you see such suffering\u2026 again, we are not of the same species.\nAnd then\u2026 I suddenly imagined the faces of my Jewish friends in that clip\u2026 Sunny or Amy or Beatrice or Sivan or Beth or, or, or\u2026 and it was like a roundhouse kick to the solar plexus. Putting the faces of actual beloved women I know, women who have enhanced my life in so many immeasurable ways\u2026 imagining that every one of those faces touched other lives in the same way. I can\u2019t even bear it.\nThe shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue yesterday again prompted me to think of my friends\u2019 faces, male and female, and how any one of those people could have been them, and despair wells in my heart. Putting a personal face on these tragedies ratchets up your empathy. Try it. Think of your own Jewish friends behind hogwire in a death camp or being herded in for a \u201cshower,\u201d or simply attending a family religious ceremony peacefully in their house of worship and then being gunned down by a racist lunatic\u2026 that\u2019ll make it sting a little more.\nI was pondering all that this morning, thinking of my Jewish friends and how I\u2019d feel if something happened to them, and then it hit me\u2026 thinking of familiar faces as victims was easy. But there\u2019s another side to that coin. What about the faces of the perpetrators? Those who shout (or silently think but won\u2019t speak the words) \u201cAll Jews Must Die!\u201d Or all Blacks. Or all Liberals. Or, or, or\u2026 what if I insert the faces of people I know who hold racist views into the role of Nazi or mass shooter? That\u2019s a whole nuther kind of sting.\nTry it. Insert the face of the most racist person you know onto the Pittsburg shooter. You know who they are. They routinely spout racist, hateful things, parrot what they hear on Right Wing TV and radio; marginalize those they irrationally despise as the \u201cother.\u201d Their \u201cother enemy.\u201d The one who steals what they feel they\u2019re entitled to, simply by virtue of the color of their skin or the symbol of their church.\nI imagine people I know throwing the switch on the showers or firing their machine guns at emaciated, naked men standing on the precipice of a mass grave in a concentration camp\u2026 and laughing. Let me tell you, it\u2019s a mind fuck. Stopping to consider that the murderers and torturers and mass shooters all have familiar faces too, to someone.\nThere\u2019s the more difficult task. Putting a human face (rather than a monster\u2019s) on those who hate and those who kill, and realizing that they\u2019re around us too. I know people like that. But I don\u2019t view them as friends. I can tolerate a great many things, but I will not tolerate a racist.\nI\u2019m not a violent person by nature. I don\u2019t believe in physically lashing out to solve differences. However, words are also weapons. What happened in Pittsburgh has renewed my resolve. I will stab a verbal machete into hateful, divisive words. Not into the people saying them. Just their words, their bigotries, their actions. Stab a machete through those. Every. Single. Time.\nYes, words are weapons. Very powerful ones. But the larger weapon is silence. If you aren\u2019t brave enough to slash hatred with words, at least don\u2019t tolerate it. Walk away from hateful people. Shun them. Cut them out of your life. Let them know it\u2019s not OK and you refuse to tolerate it. Don\u2019t participate in enabling their poisoned souls. If you think about it, shunning a racist is an act of kindness, because silence equals endorsement. It assists that person in remaining psychologically toxic.\nSilence. Stab a machete through that. If you have to start there, then start there. A small start is better than no start at all.\nTrump dishonored veterans, the military, the dead, our country, our allies and the WORLD.

{"text": "Jack calmy scanned his marching orders. As he read through it, his face turned grim. He looked up and surveyed the bridge of the Icebreaker, taking in the faces of the men he would have to depend on. Veterans all of them. People he could trust and who knew their jobs inside out. He tolerated nothing less on his ship.\nWith that in mind, he once again reread his order, making sure nothing was missed. Nope. He got everything right. He turned around to look at the captain and gave the order they were all anticipating - move out.\n\"Inform the fleet. Set a course for Corellia. Seems that trouble is brewing up there. Also, send a message to the Imperial forces stationed there that we are coming in to help protect the security of the region.\"\nAs the fleet hovered peacefully over Corellia, a secure communication was sent to Admiral Jack Williams informing him of the assignment of Rear Admiral Basea to his fleet. After recieving it, Jack decided to scan Basea's history, and immediately proceeded to dig up what he could find. What he found was that Basea was a former Commander of two Corellian corvettes and a few squadrons of Z-95 headhunters before being captured at the Battle of Derra IV and was imprisoned in Kessel. Beyond that, everything was as blank as crypt. Neverthless, he ordered the captain of the ship to prepare for the boarding of Rear Admiral Basea and to inform him as soon as that happened.\nOn the bridge, an officer quickly snapped, \"Attention on Deck. Admiral Jack Williams is on the bridge.\"\n\"Rear Admiral Basea, welcome to the Alliance Fifth Fleet! Our current mission is the defense of Corellia along with our fellow Imperial allies. As you can see, the Icebreaker is my flagship. I purpose that you settle in on either the Blade or the Star of the Republic so that in the unlikely event that the Icebreaker is destroyed, there will still be someone with valuable experience like yours to command this fleet. However, you will be taking all orders from me as long as I am living... which hopefully will be for a long time (*slight chuckle*). Your official position will be more or less 'Second in Command of the Alliance Fifth Fleet'. So, any questions or comments?\"\nUpon entering the bridge of the Icebreaker, Basea offered a crisp sallute to Admiral Williams and nodded as he was given his instructions. Settling into a semi-relaxed pose, Basea began to speak.\n\"First, I'd like to extend my gratitude for your welcome to the Fleet. I'm very excited to be serving under you, sir; if your reputation is anything to go by, I know we're all in good hands. I am, however a bit disturbed at the fact that an Alliance fleet must be stationed in orbit above Corellia...but that's as may be, I suppose.\n\"As to my choice of ship, I'd like to take on the command of Star of the Republic. I know we'll all get settled in well and in all due time be able to work as a finely tuned machine.\n\"There are, of course, a few questions I have for you, Admiral. First, what's the situation been like out here...I haven't exactly been in the center of Galactic developments as of late. Second, what are your immediate orders, other than assisting you in the command of the Fleet?\"\nDating in oviedo: welcome if you're single in oviedo and haven't tried us yet, why not try now you have nothing to lose we're a totally free dating site in oviedo paid dating sites are boring, we're a lot more fun we have singles forums, chat, groups for all types of interests, friends, and a lot more.

He was, however, dispossessed of both Macedon and Epirus by Demetrius II of Macedon, the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the Acarnanians. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus.

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982.\n\nCareer\n\nConnes was an Invited Professor at the Conservatoire national des arts et m\u00e9tiers (2000).\n\nResearch\nAlain Connes studies operator algebras. In his early work on von Neumann algebras in the 1970s, he succeeded in obtaining the almost complete classification of injective factors. He also formulated the Connes embedding problem. Following this, he made contributions in operator K-theory and index theory, which culminated in the Baum\u2013Connes conjecture. He also introduced cyclic cohomology in the early 1980s as a first step in the study of noncommutative differential geometry. He was a member of Bourbaki.\n\nConnes has applied his work in areas of mathematics and theoretical physics, including number theory, differential geometry and particle physics.\n\nAwards and honours\n\nConnes was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982, the Crafoord Prize in 2001 and the gold medal of the CNRS in 2004.

{"text": "An archipelago ( ), sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster, or collection of islands, or sometimes a sea containing a small number of scattered islands.\n\nExamples of archipelagos include: the Indonesian Archipelago, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the Lakshadweep Islands, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, the Japanese Archipelago, the Philippine Archipelago, the Maldives, the Balearic Isles, the Bahamas, the Aegean Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, the Canary Islands, Malta, the Azores, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the British Isles, the islands of the Archipelago Sea, and Shetland. They are sometimes defined by political boundaries. The Gulf archipelago off the north-eastern Pacific coast forms part of a larger archipelago that geographically includes Washington state's San Juan Islands. While the Gulf archipelago and San Juan Islands are geographically related, they are not technically included in the same archipelago due to manmade geopolitical borders.\n\nEtymology\nThe word archipelago is derived from the Ancient Greek \u1f04\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9-(arkhi-, \"chief\") and \u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (p\u00e9lagos, \"sea\") through the Italian arcipelago. In antiquity, \"Archipelago\" (from medieval Greek *\u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03c0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 and Latin ) was the proper name for the Aegean Sea. Later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea has a large number of islands).\n\nGeographic types\nArchipelagos may be found isolated in large amounts of water or neighbouring a large land mass. For example, Scotland has more than 700\u00a0islands surrounding its mainland which form an archipelago.\n\nArchipelagos are often volcanic, forming along island arcs generated by subduction zones or hotspots, but may also be the result of erosion, deposition, and land elevation. Depending on their geological origin, islands forming archipelagos can be referred to as oceanic islands, continental fragments, and continental islands.\n\nOceanic islands\nOceanic islands are mainly of volcanic origin, and widely separated from any adjacent continent. The Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island in the Pacific, and \u00cele Amsterdam in the south Indian Ocean are examples.\n\nContinental fragments\nContinental fragments correspond to land masses that have separated from a continental mass due to tectonic displacement. The Farallon Islands off the coast of California are an example.\n\nContinental archipelagos\n\nSets of islands formed close to the coast of a continent are considered continental archipelagos when they form part of the same continental shelf, when those islands are above-water extensions of the shelf. The islands of the Inside Passage off the coast of British Columbia and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago are examples.\n\nArtificial archipelagos\nArtificial archipelagos have been created in various countries for different purposes. Palm Islands and the World Islands off Dubai were or are being created for leisure and tourism purposes. Marker Wadden in the Netherlands is being built as a conservation area for birds and other wildlife.\n\nFurther examples\nThe largest archipelagic state in the world by area, and by population, is Indonesia.\n\nSee also \n\n Island arc\n List of landforms\n List of archipelagos by number of islands\n List of archipelagos\n Archipelagic state\n List of islands\n Aquapelago\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n 30 Most Incredible Island Archipelagos\n\n \nCoastal and oceanic landforms\nOceanographical terminology", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "3399", "entropy": "4.514951548466745", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4397432156405019", "brevity_score": "0.003787878787878805"}

{"text": "In the Book of Exodus, Amram (; ) is the husband of Jochebed and father of Aaron, Moses and Miriam.\n\nIn the Bible \n\nIn addition to being married to Jochebed, Amram is also described in the Bible as having been related to Jochebed prior to the marriage, although the exact relationship is uncertain; some Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Septuagint state that Jochebed was Amram's father's cousin, and others state that Amram was Jochebed's cousin, but the Masoretic Text states that she was his father's sister.  He is praised for his faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews.\n\nTextual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the Book of Generations, a hypothetically reconstructed document theorized to originate from a similar religiopolitical group and date to the priestly source. According to critical scholars, the Torah's genealogy for Levi's descendants, is actually an aetiological myth reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the Levites \u2013 the Gershonites, Kohathites, Merarites, and Aaronids; Aaron \u2013 the eponymous ancestor of the Aaronids \u2013 could not be portrayed as a brother to Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, as the narrative about the birth of Moses (brother of Aaron), which textual scholars attribute to the earlier Elohist source, mentions only that both his parents were Levites (without identifying their names). Critical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both matrilineal and patrilineal descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses.\n\nArabic \nAmram in Arabic is spelled  (\u2018Imr\u0101n ), was the husband of Jochebed and father of Moses and Aaron. As mentioned by his given name, M\u00fbs\u00e2 bin 'Imr\u0101n, which means Moses, son of Amram.\n\nFamily tree \n\nAccording to the Septuagint, Amram's family tree would be as follows:\n\nAccording to the Masoretic Text, Amram's family tree would be:\n\nAccording to The Book of Jasher, Amram's family tree would be:\n\n  Amram married his aunt, Jochebed, the sister of his father Kehath.\n\nIn rabbinical and apocryphal literature \n\nIn the Apocryphal Testament of Levi, it is stated that Amram was born, as a grandson of Levi, when Levi was 64 years old. The Exodus Rabbah argues that when the Pharaoh instructed midwives to throw male children into the Nile, Amram divorced Jochebed, who was three months pregnant with Moses at the time, arguing that there was no justification for the Israelite men to father children if they were just to be killed; however, the text goes on to state that Miriam, his daughter, chided him for his lack of care for his wife's feelings, persuading him to recant and marry Jochebed again. According to the Talmud, Amram promulgated the laws of marriage and divorce amongst the Jews in Egypt; the Talmud also argues that Amram had extreme longevity, which he used to ensure that doctrines were preserved through several generations.\n\nDespite the legend of his divorce and remarriage, Amram was also held to have been entirely sinless throughout his life, and was rewarded for this by his corpse remaining without any signs of decay.  The other three  ancient Israelites who died without sin, being Benjamin, Jesse and Chileab.\n\nAccording to the Book of Jubilees, Amram was among the Israelites who took the bones of Jacob's sons (excluding those of Joseph) to Canaan for burial in the cave of Machpelah. Most of the Israelites then returned to Egypt but some remained in Canaan. Those who remained included Amram, who only returned somewhere up to forty years later.\n\nOne of the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q544, Manuscript B) is written from Amram's point of view, and hence has been dubbed the Visions of Amram. The document is dated to the 2nd century BC and, in the form of a vision, briefly discusses dualism and the Watchers:\n\nSee also \n Al Imran, \"The Family of Imran\", 3rd chapter of the Quran \nJoachim, father of Mary, mother of Jesus\n\nReferences \n\nAncient Egyptian Jews\nLevites\nBook of Exodus people\nPeople of the Quran\nMoses\nFamily of Aaron\nTribe of Levi\nBook of Jubilees\nEpistle to the Hebrews", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "4035", "entropy": "4.500315385014435", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4625648628613788", "brevity_score": "0.0028571428571428476"}

{"text": "Amalasuintha (30 April 534/535) was an Ostrogoth queen and regent. She ruled the Ostrogoths as regent during the minority of her son from 526 to 534 and then as queen regnant from 534 to 535. She was the youngest daughter of Theoderic the Great, and firmly believed in the upholding of Roman virtues and values. She is best known for her diplomatic relationship with Justinian I, who invaded Italy in response to her assassination.\n\nPersonal life \n\nIn 515, Amalasuintha married Eutharic (522), an Ostrogoth noble of the old Amali dynasty who had been previously living in the Arian Kingdom of Hispania. Her husband was the son of Widerich (born ), grandson of Berismund (born ), and great-grandson of Thorismund (died after 400), king of the Ostrogoths . It was important to Amalasuintha's father, Theoderic the Great, that she marry into a legitimate royal family, lest her own family's legitimacy be questioned.\n\nShe was very much an intellectual, and was well known for her extensive knowledge and reading, which included fluency in Latin, Greek and Gothic. In addition, she was a student of philosophy and was said to possess the wisdom of Solomon. Amalasuintha was also described in her day as possessing all of the central Roman virtues expected of a noble woman: happiness, fertility, and patience, although more emphasis was placed on her virtues within the political realm versus the feminine, something that separates her from other Ostrogoth princesses. Like most Ostrogoths, Amalasuintha was an Arian Christian.\n\nEutharic died, apparently in the early years of his marriage to Amalasuintha, leaving her with two children, Athalaric and Matasuntha (after 550).\n\nRule\n\nRegent\nOn the death of her father on 30 August 526, her son succeeded him at the age of ten, but she held the power as regent for her son. Her tremendous influence in her position as regent can be seen in a diptych of Rufius Gennadius Probus Orestes in which she appears alongside her son, Athalaric, in 530. Deeply imbued with the old Roman culture, she gave to that son's education a more refined and literary turn than suited the ideas of her Gothic subjects. Conscious of her unpopularity she banished \u2013 and afterwards put to death \u2013 three Gothic nobles whom she suspected of conspiring against her rule. At the same time, she opened negotiations with the Byzantine emperor Justinian I with the view of removing herself and the Gothic treasure to Constantinople. Her son's death on 2 October 534 initially made little apparent change in the state of affairs.\n\nQueen\nAfter Athalaric's death, Amalasuintha became queen, ruling alone only for a short while before making her cousin Theodahad co-ruler (not, as sometimes stated, her husband, for his wife was still living), with the intent of strengthening her position. Theodahad was a prominent leader of the Gothic military aristocracy, the very group that so opposed her pro-Roman stances. Amalasuintha believed this pairing would help to make supporters out of her harshest critics. However, Theodahad fostered the disaffection of the Goths, and either by his orders or with his permission, Amalasuintha was imprisoned on the island of Martana, located in the lake of Bolsena in northern Lazio, where on 30 April in the spring of 534/535, she was murdered in her bath.\n\nDeath\n\nThe death of Amalasuintha gave Justinian I a reason to go to war with the Ostrogoths and attempt to take Italy. According to the Eastern Roman historian Procopius, it is believed that Amalasuintha and Justinian I had a very close diplomatic relationship. More specifically, Procopius believed that Amalasuintha was thinking about handing over Italy to Justinian around the time of her death. Shortly after Amalasuintha's murder, Theodahad was replaced by Witigis, Amalasuintha's son-in-law. With the people's support, Witigis had Theodahad put to death.\n\nSources \nThe letters of Cassiodorus, chief minister and literary adviser of Amalasuintha, and the histories of Procopius and Jordanes, give us our chief information as to the character of Amalasuintha. Cassiodorus was a part of a greater pro-Roman party that desired to Romanize the traditional Ostrogothic kingship, further evidence of the pro-Roman circle that Amalasuintha surrounded herself with.\n\nLegacy\n\nThe life of Amalasuintha was made the subject of a tragedy, the first play written by the young Carlo Goldoni and presented at Milan in 1733.\n\nRomanian poet George Co\u0219buc wrote a poem entitled The Queen of the Ostrogoths in which Amalasuintha (named Amalasunda in the poem) speaks to Theodahad (mentioned as  Teodat in the poem) shortly before he kills her.\n\nAsteroid 650 Amalasuntha is named in her honour.\n\nAmalasuintha is portrayed by Honor Blackman in the 1968 film Kampf um Rom.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nCraddock, Jonathan Paul.

{"text": "An algebraic number is a number that is a root of a non-zero polynomial in one variable with integer (or, equivalently, rational) coefficients.  For example, the golden ratio, , is an algebraic number, because it is a root of the polynomial . That is, it is a value for x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero.  As another example, the complex number  is algebraic because it is a root of .\n\nAll integers and rational numbers are algebraic, as are all roots of integers. Real and complex numbers that are not algebraic, such as  and , are called transcendental numbers.\n\nThe set  of algebraic numbers is countably infinite and has measure zero in the Lebesgue measure as a subset of the uncountable complex numbers. In that sense, almost all complex numbers are transcendental.\n\nExamples\n All rational numbers are algebraic. Any rational number, expressed as the quotient of an integer  and a (non-zero) natural number , satisfies the above definition, because  is the root of a non-zero polynomial, namely .\n Quadratic irrational numbers, irrational solutions of a quadratic polynomial  with integer coefficients , , and ), are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic (), the roots are further qualified as quadratic integers.\n Gaussian integers, complex numbers  for which both  and  are integers, are also quadratic integers. This is because  and  are the two roots of the quadratic .\n A constructible number can be constructed from a given unit length using a straightedge and compass. It includes all quadratic irrational roots, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the basic arithmetic operations and the extraction of square roots. (By designating cardinal directions for 1, \u22121, , and \u2212, complex numbers such as  are considered constructible.)\n Any expression formed from algebraic numbers using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of th roots gives another algebraic number.\n Polynomial roots that cannot be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of th roots (such as the roots of ). That happens with many but not all polynomials of degree 5 or higher.\n Values of trigonometric functions of rational multiples of  (except when undefined): for example, , , and  satisfy . This polynomial is irreducible over the rationals and so the three cosines are conjugate algebraic numbers. Likewise, , , , and  satisfy the irreducible polynomial , and so are conjugate algebraic integers.\n Some but not all irrational numbers are algebraic:\n The numbers  and  are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials  and , respectively.\n The golden ratio  is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial .\n The numbers  and e are not algebraic numbers (see the Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem).\n\nProperties\n\nIf a polynomial with rational coefficients is multiplied through by the least common denominator, the resulting polynomial with integer coefficients has the same roots.  This shows that an algebraic number can be equivalently defined as a root of a polynomial with either integer or rational coefficients.\nGiven an algebraic number, there is a unique monic polynomial with rational coefficients of least degree that has the number as a root. This polynomial is called its minimal polynomial. If its minimal polynomial has degree , then the algebraic number is said to be of degree . For example, all rational numbers have degree 1, and an algebraic number of degree 2 is a quadratic irrational.\nThe algebraic numbers are dense in the reals.  This follows from the fact they contain the rational numbers, which are dense in the reals themselves.\nThe set of algebraic numbers is countable (enumerable), and therefore its Lebesgue measure as a subset of the complex numbers is 0 (essentially, the algebraic numbers take up no space in the complex numbers). That is to say, \"almost all\" real and complex numbers are transcendental.\nAll algebraic numbers are computable and therefore definable and arithmetical.\nFor real numbers  and , the complex number  is algebraic if and only if both  and  are algebraic.\n\nField\n\nThe sum, difference, product and quotient (if the denominator is nonzero) of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic, as can be demonstrated by using the resultant, and algebraic numbers thus form a field  (sometimes denoted by , but that usually denotes the adele ring). Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are algebraic numbers is again algebraic. That can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is algebraically closed. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically-closed field containing the rationals and so it is called the algebraic closure of the rationals.\n\nThe set of real algebraic numbers itself forms a field.\n\nRelated fields\n\nNumbers defined by radicals\nAny number that can be obtained from the integers using a finite number of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and taking (possibly complex) th roots where  is a positive integer are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. These numbers are roots of polynomials of degree\u00a05 or higher, a result of Galois theory (see Quintic equations and the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem). For example, the equation:\n\nhas a unique real root that cannot be expressed in terms of only radicals and arithmetic operations.\n\nClosed-form number\n\nAlgebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to \"closed-form numbers\", which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called \"elementary numbers\", and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers explicitly defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms \u2013 this does not include all algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as  or ln\u00a02.\n\nAlgebraic integers\n\nAn algebraic integer is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). Examples of algebraic integers are   and  Therefore, the algebraic integers constitute a proper superset of the integers, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials  for all . In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what integers are to rational numbers.\n\nThe sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a ring. The name algebraic integer comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any number field are in many ways analogous to the integers. If  is a number field, its ring of integers is the subring of algebraic integers in , and is frequently denoted as . These are the prototypical examples of Dedekind domains.\n\nSpecial classes\nAlgebraic solution\nGaussian integer\nEisenstein integer\nQuadratic irrational number\nFundamental unit\nRoot of unity\nGaussian period\nPisot\u2013Vijayaraghavan number\nSalem number\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nHardy, G.

{"text": "In linguistics, an affix is a morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word or word form. Affixes may be derivational, like English -ness and pre-, or inflectional, like English plural -s and past tense -ed. They are bound morphemes by definition; prefixes and suffixes may be separable affixes. Affixation is the linguistic process that speakers use to form different words by adding morphemes at the beginning (prefixation), the middle (infixation) or the end (suffixation) of words.\n\nPositional categories of affixes\nAffixes are divided into many categories, depending on their position with reference to the stem. Prefix and suffix are extremely common terms. Infix and circumfix are less so, as they are not important in European languages. The other terms are uncommon.\n\nPrefix and suffix may be subsumed under the term adfix, in contrast to infix.\n\nWhen marking text for interlinear glossing, as in the third column in the chart above, simple affixes such as prefixes and suffixes are separated from the stem with hyphens. Affixes which disrupt the stem, or which themselves are discontinuous, are often marked off with angle brackets. Reduplication is often shown with a tilde. Affixes which cannot be segmented are marked with a back slash.\n\nLexical affixes\nLexical affixes (or semantic affixes) are bound elements that appear as affixes, but function as incorporated nouns within verbs and as elements of nouns. In other words, they are similar to word roots/stems in function but similar to affixes in form. Although similar to incorporated nouns, lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns, i.e. they always appear as affixes.\n\nLexical affixes are relatively rare. The Wakashan, Salishan, and Chimakuan languages all have lexical suffixes \u2014 the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest of North America.\n\nThe lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings. Compare the lexical suffixes and free nouns of Northern Straits Saanich written in the Saanich orthography and in Americanist notation:\n\nLexical suffixes, when compared with free nouns, often have a more generic or general meaning. For instance, one of these languages may have a lexical suffix that means water in a general sense, but it may not have any noun equivalent referring to water in general and instead have several nouns with a more specific meaning (such \"saltwater\", \"whitewater\", etc.). In other cases, the lexical suffixes have become grammaticalized to various degrees.\n\nSome linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs. Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic arguments just as free nouns are and, thus, equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns. Gerdts (2003) gives examples of lexical suffixes in the Halkomelem language (the word order here is verb\u2013subject\u2013object):\n\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\"\n|- style=\"line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 75%\"\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #bbbbff\" | VERB\n| style=\"background: #ffebad\" | SUBJ\n| style=\"background: #ffbbbb\" | OBJ\n|-\n| (1)\n| ni\u0294\n| \u0161ak\u2019\u02b7-\u0259t-\u0259s\n| \u0142\u0259 s\u0142eni\u0294\n| \u0142\u0259 qeq\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" | \"the woman washed the baby\"\n|- style=\"line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 75%\"\n| bgcolor=white colspan=5|\u00a0\n|- style=\"line-height: 1.0em; font-size: 75%\"\n|\n|\n| style=\"background: #bbbbff\" | VERB+LEX.SUFF\n| style=\"background: #ffebad\" | SUBJ\n|\n|-\n| (2)\n| ni\u0294\n| \u0161k\u2019\u02b7-\u0259y\u0259\u0142\n| \u0142\u0259 s\u0142eni\u0294\n|\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"4\" | \"the woman baby-washed\"\n|}\n\nIn sentence (1), the verb \"wash\" is \u0161ak\u2019\u02b7\u0259t\u0259s where \u0161ak\u2019\u02b7- is the root and -\u0259t and -\u0259s are inflectional suffixes. The subject \"the woman\" is \u0142\u0259 s\u0142eni\u0294 and the object \"the baby\" is \u0142\u0259 qeq. In this sentence, \"the baby\" is a free noun. (The ni\u0294 here is an auxiliary, which can be ignored for explanatory purposes.)\n\nIn sentence (2), \"baby\" does not appear as a free noun. Instead it appears as the lexical suffix -\u0259y\u0259\u0142 which is affixed to the verb root \u0161k\u2019\u02b7- (which has changed slightly in pronunciation, but this can also be ignored here). Note how the lexical suffix is neither \"the baby\" (definite) nor \"a baby\" (indefinite); such referential changes are routine with incorporated nouns.\n\nOrthographic affixes\nIn orthography, the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters. For example, Maya glyphs are generally compounds of a main sign and smaller affixes joined at its margins. These are called prefixes, superfixes, postfixes, and subfixes according to their position to the left, on top, to the right, or at the bottom of the main glyph. A small glyph placed inside another is called an infix. Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the Indic alphabets. For example, the Tibetan alphabet utilizes prefix, suffix, superfix, and subfix consonant letters.\n\nSee also\n\n Agglutination\n Augmentative\n Binary prefix\n Clitic\n Combining form\n Concatenation\n Diminutive\n English prefixes\n Family name affixes\n Internet-related prefixes\n Marker (linguistics)\n Morphological derivation\n Separable affix\n SI prefix\n Stemming - affix removal using computer software\n Unpaired word\n Word formation\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n Montler, Timothy.

{"text": "Arachnophobia is a specific phobia brought about by the irrational fear of spiders and other arachnids such as scorpions.\n\nSigns and symptoms\nPeople with arachnophobia tend to feel uneasy in any area they believe could harbour spiders or that has visible signs of their presence, such as webs. If an arachnophobe sees a spider, they may not enter the general vicinity until they have overcome the panic attack that is often associated with their phobia. Some people scream, cry, have emotional outbursts, experience trouble breathing, sweat and feel increased heart rates when they come in contact with an area near spiders or their webs. In some extreme cases, even a picture, a toy, or a realistic drawing of a spider can trigger intense fear.\n\nReasons\nArachnophobia may be an exaggerated form of an instinctive response that helped early humans to survive or a cultural phenomenon that is most common in predominantly European societies.\n\nEvolutionary\nAn evolutionary reason for the phobia remains unresolved. One view, especially held in evolutionary psychology, is that the presence of venomous spiders led to the evolution of a fear of spiders, or made acquisition of a fear of spiders especially easy. Like all traits, there is variability in the intensity of fear of spiders, and those with more intense fears are classified as phobic. Being relatively small, spiders do not fit the usual criterion for a threat in the animal kingdom where size is a factor, but they can have medically significant venom and/or cause skin irritation with their setae.  However, a phobia is an irrational fear as opposed to a rational fear.\n\nBy ensuring that their surroundings were free from spiders, arachnophobes would have had a reduced risk of being bitten in ancestral environments, giving them a slight advantage over non-arachnophobes in terms of survival. However, having a disproportionate fear of spiders in comparison to other, potentially dangerous creatures present during Homo sapiens environment of evolutionary adaptiveness may have had drawbacks.\n\nIn The Handbook of the Emotions (1993), psychologist Arne \u00d6hman studied pairing an unconditioned stimulus with evolutionarily-relevant fear-response neutral stimuli (snakes and spiders) versus evolutionarily-irrelevant fear-response neutral stimuli (mushrooms, flowers, physical representation of polyhedra, firearms, and electrical outlets) on human subjects and found that ophidiophobia and arachnophobia required only one pairing to develop a conditioned response while mycophobia, anthophobia, phobias of physical representations of polyhedra, firearms, and electrical outlets required multiple pairings and went extinct without continued conditioning while the conditioned ophidiophobia and arachnophobia were permanent.\n\nPsychiatrist Randolph M. Nesse notes that while conditioned fear responses to evolutionarily novel dangerous objects such as electrical outlets is possible, the conditioning is slower because such cues have no prewired connection to fear, noting further that despite the emphasis of the risks of speeding and drunk driving in driver's education, it alone does not provide reliable protection against traffic collisions and that nearly one-quarter of all deaths in 2014 of people aged 15 to 24 in the United States were in traffic collisions. Nesse, psychiatrist Isaac Marks, and evolutionary biologist George C. Williams have noted that people with systematically deficient responses to various adaptive phobias (e.g. arachnophobia, ophidiophobia, basophobia) are more temperamentally careless and more likely to end up in potentially fatal accidents and have proposed that such deficient phobia should be classified as \"hypophobia'\" due to its selfish genetic consequences.\n\nA 2001 study found that people could detect images of spiders among images of flowers and mushrooms more quickly than they could detect images of flowers or mushrooms among images of spiders. The researchers suggested that this was because fast response to spiders was more relevant to human evolution.\n\nCultural\nAn alternative view is that the dangers, such as from spiders, are overrated and not sufficient to influence evolution. Instead, inheriting phobias would have restrictive and debilitating effects upon survival, rather than being an aid. For some communities such as in Papua New Guinea and Cambodia spiders are included in traditional foods. This suggests arachnophobia may, at least in part, be a cultural, rather than genetic trait.\n\nTreatments\nThe fear of spiders can be treated by any of the general techniques suggested for specific phobias. The first line of treatment is systematic desensitization\u00a0\u2013 also known as exposure therapy. Before engaging in systematic desensitization, it is common to train the individual with arachnophobia in relaxation techniques, which will help keep the patient calm. Systematic desensitization can be done in vivo (with live spiders) or by getting the individual to imagine situations involving spiders, then modelling interaction with spiders for the person affected and eventually interacting with real spiders. This technique can be effective in just one session, although it generally takes more time.\n\nRecent advances in technology have enabled the use of virtual or augmented reality spiders for use in therapy. These techniques have proven to be effective.  It has been suggested that exposure to short clips from the Spider-Man movies may help to reduce an individual's arachnophobia.\n\nEpidemiology\nArachnophobia affects 3.5 to 6.1 percent of the global population.\n\nSee also\n Apiphobia (fear of bees)\n Entomophobia (fear of insects)\n Myrmecophobia (fear of ants)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nNational Geographic: \"Fear of Snakes, Spiders Rooted in Evolution, Study Finds\"\n\nZoophobias\nArachnids and humans", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "5826", "entropy": "4.396777878296199", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.44768439108061747", "brevity_score": "0.002066115702479363"}
{"text": "In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean ( ) or arithmetic average, or simply just the mean or the average (when the context is clear), is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection. The collection is often a set of results of an experiment or an observational study, or frequently a set of results from a survey. The term \"arithmetic mean\" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics, because it helps distinguish it from other means, such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean.\n\nIn addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as economics, anthropology and history, and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. For example, per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.\n\nWhile the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies, it is not a robust statistic, meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values). For skewed distributions, such as the distribution of income for which a few people's incomes are substantially greater than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one's notion of \"middle\", and robust statistics, such as the median, may provide better description of central tendency.\n\nDefinition\nGiven a data set , the arithmetic mean (or mean or average), denoted  (read  bar), is the mean of the  values .\n\nThe arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a data set. In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation, divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set consisting of the values , then the arithmetic mean  is defined by the formula:\n\n(for an explanation of the summation operator, see summation.)\n\nFor example, consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400. The arithmetic mean is\n\n \n\nIf the data set is a statistical population (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the population mean, and denoted by the Greek letter . If the data set is a statistical sample (a subset of the population), then we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean (which for a data set  is denoted as ).\n\nThe arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vectors in multiple dimension, not only scalar values; this is often referred to as a centroid. More generally, because the arithmetic mean is a convex combination (coefficients sum to 1), it can be defined on a convex space, not only a vector space.\n\nMotivating properties\n\nThe arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:\n\n If numbers  have mean , then . Since  is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the residuals (deviations from the estimate) sum to zero.\n If it is required to use a single number as a \"typical\" value for a set of known numbers , then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value: the sum of . (It follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest root mean squared error.) If the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired, then the estimate of it that is unbiased is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.\n\nContrast with median\n\nThe arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median. The median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than, and no more than half are smaller than, the median. If elements in the data increase arithmetically, when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample . The average is , as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as , the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2, while the median is 4. In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.\n\nThere are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.\n\nGeneralizations\n\nWeighted average\n\nA weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation. For example, the arithmetic mean of  and  is , or equivalently . In contrast, a weighted mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as . Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are  and , the former being twice the latter. The arithmetic mean (sometimes called the \"unweighted average\" or \"equally weighted average\") can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to  in the above example, and equal to  in a situation with  numbers being averaged).\n\nContinuous probability distributions\n\nIf a numerical property, and any sample of data from it, could take on any value from a continuous range, instead of, for example, just integers, then the probability of a number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating a continuous probability distribution across this range, even when the naive probability for a sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero. The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinite number of possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range, is called the mean of the probability distribution. A most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode (the three\u00a0M's), are equal to each other. This equality does not hold for other probability distributions, as illustrated for the log-normal distribution here.\n\nAngles\n\nParticular care must be taken when using cyclic data, such as phases or angles. Naively taking the arithmetic mean of 1\u00b0 and 359\u00b0 yields a result of 180\u00b0.\nThis is incorrect for two reasons:\n Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of 360\u00b0 (or 2\u03c0, if measuring in radians). Thus one could as easily call these 1\u00b0 and \u22121\u00b0, or 361\u00b0 and 719\u00b0, since each one of them gives a different average.\n Secondly, in this situation, 0\u00b0 (equivalently, 360\u00b0) is geometrically a better average value: there is lower dispersion about it (the points are both 1\u00b0 from it, and 179\u00b0 from 180\u00b0, the putative average).\n\nIn general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation (viz., define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1\u00b0 and 359\u00b0 is 2\u00b0, not 358\u00b0).\n\nSymbols and encoding \nThe arithmetic mean is often denoted by a bar, (a.k.a vinculum or macron), for example as in  (read  bar).\n\nSome software (text processors, web browsers) may not display the x\u0304 symbol properly. For example, the x\u0304 symbol in HTML is actually a combination of two codes - the base letter x plus a code for the line above (&#772; or \u00af).\n\nIn some texts, such as pdfs, the x\u0304 symbol may be replaced by a cent (\u00a2) symbol (Unicode &#162), when copied to text processor such as Microsoft Word.\n\nSee also\n\n Fr\u00e9chet mean\n Generalized mean\n Geometric mean\n Harmonic mean\n Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means\n Mode\n Sample mean and covariance\n Standard deviation\n Standard error of the mean\n Summary statistics\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n Calculations and comparisons between arithmetic mean and geometric mean of two numbers\n Calculate the arithmetic mean of a series of numbers on fxSolver\n\nMeans", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "8905", "entropy": "4.4046989004035035", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.38692342140618", "brevity_score": "0.0018018018018018166"}

{"text": "The Hebrew term Abaddon ( \u2019\u0102\u1e07ad\u014dn, meaning \"destruction\", \"doom\"), and its Greek equivalent Apollyon (, Apoll\u00fa\u014dn meaning \"Destroyer\") appear in the Bible as both a place of destruction and an archangel of the abyss. In the Hebrew Bible, abaddon is used with reference to a bottomless pit, often appearing alongside the place Sheol ( \u0160\u0259\u02be\u014dl), meaning the realm of the dead.\n\nIn the Book of Revelation of the New Testament, an angel called Abaddon is described as the king of an army of locusts; his name is first transcribed in Koine Greek (Revelation 9:11\u2014\"whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon,\") as , and then translated , Apollyon. The Vulgate and the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible have additional notes not present in the Greek text, \"in Latin Exterminans\", exterminans being the Latin word for \"destroyer\".\n\nEtymology\nAccording to the Brown\u2013Driver\u2013Briggs lexicon, the Hebrew  \u2019\u0103\u1e07ad\u014dn is an intensive form of the Semitic root and verb stem  \u2019\u0103\u1e07\u0101\u1e0f  \"perish\", transitive \"destroy\", which occurs 184 times in the Hebrew Bible. The Septuagint, an early Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, renders \"Abaddon\" as \"\u1f00\u03c0\u03ce\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\", while the Greek Apoll\u00fdon is the active participle of \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9 ap\u00f3llymi, \"to destroy\".\n\nJudaism\n\nHebrew Bible\nThe term abaddon appears six times in the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible; abaddon means destruction or \"place of destruction\", or the realm of the dead, and is accompanied by Sheol. \n Job 26:6: the grave (Sheol) is naked before Him, and destruction (Abaddon) has no covering.\n Job 28:22: destruction (Abaddon) and death say.\n Job 31:12: it is a fire that consumes to destruction (Abaddon).\n Psalm 88:11: Shall thy loving kindness be declared in the grave (Sheol) or thy faithfulness in destruction (Abaddon)?\n Proverbs 15:11: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are before the LORD, how much more the hearts of the children of men?\n Proverbs 27:20: Hell (Sheol) and Destruction (Abaddon) are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied. (KJV, 1611)\n\nSecond Temple era texts\nThe text of the Thanksgiving Hymns\u2014which was found in the Dead Sea Scrolls\u2014tells of \"the Sheol of Abaddon\" and of the \"torrents of Belial [that] burst into Abaddon\". The Biblical Antiquities (misattributed to Philo) mentions Abaddon as a place (destruction) rather than an individual. Abaddon is also one of the compartments of Gehenna. By extension, it can mean an underworld abode of lost souls, or Gehenna.\n\nRabbinical literature\nIn some legends, Abaddon is identified as a realm where the damned lie in fire and snow, one of the places in Gehenna that Moses visited.\n\nChristianity\n\nNew Testament\nThe New Testament contains the first known depiction of Abaddon as an individual entity instead of a place.\n\nIn Revelation 9:11, Abaddon is described as \"Destroyer\", the angel of the Abyss, and as the king of a plague of locusts resembling horses with crowned human faces, women's hair, lions' teeth, wings, iron breast-plates, and a tail with a scorpion's stinger that torments for five months anyone who does not have the seal of God on their foreheads.\n\nThe symbolism of Revelation 9:11 leaves the identity of Abaddon open to interpretation. Protestant commentator Matthew Henry (1708) believed Abaddon to be the Antichrist, whereas the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary (1871) and Henry Hampton Halley (1922) identified the angel as Satan.\n\nIn contrast, the Methodist publication The Interpreter's Bible states, \"Abaddon, however, is an angel not of Satan but of God, performing his work of destruction at God's bidding\", citing the context at Revelation chapter 20, verses 1 through 3. Jehovah's Witnesses also cite Revelation 20:1-3 where the angel having \"the key of the abyss\" is actually shown to be a representative of God, concluding that \"Abaddon\" is another name for Jesus after his resurrection.\n\nApocryphal texts\nIn the gnostic 3rd century Acts of Thomas, Abaddon is the name of a demon, or the devil himself.\n\nAbaddon is given particularly important roles in two sources, a homily entitled \"The Enthronement of Abaddon\" by pseudo-Timothy of Alexandria, and the Book of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, by Bartholomew the Apostle. In the homily by Timothy, Abaddon was first named Muriel, and had been given the task by God of collecting the earth that would be used in the creation of Adam. Upon completion of this task, the angel was appointed as a guardian. Everyone, including the angels, demons, and corporeal entities feared him. Abaddon was promised that any who venerated him in life could be saved. Abaddon is also said to have a prominent role in the Last Judgment, as the one who will take the souls to the Valley of Josaphat. He is described in the Book of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as being present in the Tomb of Jesus at the moment of the resurrection of Jesus.\n\nSee also\n Abaddon in popular culture\n Hades\n\nCitations\n\nGeneral bibliography\n\nExternal links \n \n \n\nAngels in Christianity\nBook of Revelation\nHebrew Bible places\nHell (Christianity)\nIndividual angels\nJewish underworld\nSatan", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "5032", "entropy": "4.678954964113744", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4771074867360975", "brevity_score": "0.0023640661938534174"}

{"text": "Amazonite, also known as Amazonstone, is a green tectosilicate mineral, a variety of the potassium feldspar called microcline. Its chemical formula is KAlSi3O8, which is polymorphic to orthoclase.\n\nIts name is taken from that of the Amazon River, from which green stones were formerly obtained, though it is unknown whether those stones were amazonite. Although it has been used for over two thousand years, as attested by archaeological finds in Egypt and Mesopotamia, no ancient or medieval authority mentions it. It was first described as a distinct mineral only in the 18th century.\n\nGreen and greenish-blue varieties of potassium feldspars that are predominantly triclinic are designated\nas amazonite. It has been described as a \"beautiful crystallized variety of a bright verdigris-green\" and as possessing a \"lively green colour.\" It is occasionally cut and used as a gemstone.\n\nOccurrence \n\nAmazonite is a mineral of limited occurrence. Formerly it was obtained almost exclusively from the area of Miass in the Ilmensky Mountains, 50 miles southwest of Chelyabinsk, Russia, where it occurs in granitic rocks. \n\nAmazonite is now known to occur in various places around the globe. Those places are, among others, as follows:\n\nChina:\n Baishitouquan granite intrusion, Hami Prefecture, Xinjiang: found in granite\nLibya:\n Jabal Eghei, Tibesti Mountains: found in granitic rocks\nMongolia:\n Avdar Massif, T\u00f6v Province: found in alkali granite\n\nSouth Africa:\n\n Mogalakwena, Limpopo Province\n Kh\u00e2i-Ma, Northern Cape\n Kakamas, Northern Cape\n Ceres Valley, Western Cape\n\nUnited States:\n Colorado:\n Deer Trail, Arapahoe County:233\n Custer County:234\n Devils Head, Douglas County:234\n Pine Creek, Douglas County:234\n Crystal Park, El Paso County:234\n Pikes Peak, El Paso County: found in coarse granites or pegmatite\n St. Peter's Dome, El Paso County:234\n Tarryall Mountains, Park County:235\n Crystal Peak, Teller County:235\n Virginia:\n Morefield Mine, Amelia County: found in pegmatite\n Rutherford Mine, Amelia County\n Pennsylvania:\n Media, Delaware County:244\n Middletown, Delaware County:244\n\nColor \n\nFor many years, the source of amazonite's color was a mystery. Some people assumed the color was due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors. A 1985 study suggest that the blue-green color results from quantities of lead and water in the feldspar. Subsequent 1998 theoretical studies by A. Julg expand on the potential role of aliovalent lead in the color of microcline.\n\nOther studies suggest the colors are associated with the increasing content of lead, rubidium, and thallium ranging in amounts between 0.00X and 0.0X in the feldspars, with even extremely high contents of PbO, lead monoxide, (1% or more) known from the literature. A recent 2010 study also implicated the role of divalent iron in the green coloration. These studies and associated hypotheses indicate the complex nature of the color in amazonite, in other words the aggregate effect of several mutually inclusive and necessary factors.\n\nHealth \nA 2021 study by the German Institut f\u00fcr Edelsteinpr\u00fcfung (EPI) found that the amount of lead that leaked from a  sample of Amazonite into an acidic solution simulating saliva exceeded European Union standard DIN EN 71-3:2013's recommended amount by five times. This experiment was to simulate a child swallowing Amazonite, and could also apply to new wellness practices such as inserting the mineral into oils or drinking water for days.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links \n\nFeldspar\nGemstones", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "3556", "entropy": "4.679791715177172", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.5146067415730337", "brevity_score": "0.0030211480362537886"}

He had an office in the Library of Alexandria, and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant. He spent some time, together with Antagoras and Aratus, at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas.\n\nNotwithstanding the distinction Alexander enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, elegies, epigrams, and cynaedi.  Among his epic poems, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the Fisherman, Kirka or Krika, which, however, is designated by Athenaeus as doubtful, and Helena,  Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant.<ref>Scholiast and Eustathius, ad Il. iii. 314</ref>  His Cynaedi, or Ionic poems'' (), are mentioned by Strabo and Athenaeus.

{"text": "Agate () is a common rock formation, consisting of chalcedony and quartz as its primary components, with a wide variety of colors. Agates are primarily formed within volcanic and metamorphic rocks. The ornamental use of agate dates back to Ancient Greece in assorted jewelry and in the seal stones of Greek warriors. Use of beads necklaces with pierced and polished agate goes further back to the 3rd millennium BCE in the Indus Valley Civilisation.\n\nEtymology and history\nThe stone was given its name by Theophrastus, a Greek philosopher and naturalist, who discovered the stone along the shore line of the Dirillo River or Achates () in Sicily, sometime between the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE.\n\nAncient use\nAgate is one of the most common materials used in the art of hardstone carving, and has been recovered at a number of ancient sites, indicating its widespread use in the ancient world; for example, archaeological recovery at the Knossos site on Crete illustrates its role in Bronze Age Minoan culture.\n\nFormation and characteristics\n\nAgate minerals have the tendency to form on or within pre-existing rocks, creating difficulties in accurately determining their time of formation. Their host rocks have been dated to have formed as early as the Archean Eon. Agates are most commonly found as nodules within the cavities of volcanic rocks. These cavities are formed from the gases trapped within the liquid volcanic material forming vesicles. Cavities are then filled in with silica-rich fluids from the volcanic material, layers are deposited on the walls of the cavity slowly working their way inwards. The first layer deposited on the cavity walls is commonly known as the priming layer. Variations in the character of the solution or in the conditions of deposition may cause a corresponding variation in the successive layers. These variations in layers result in bands of chalcedony, often alternating with layers of crystalline quartz forming banded agate. Hollow agates can also form due to the deposition of liquid-rich silica not penetrating deep enough to fill the cavity completely. Agate will form crystals within the reduced cavity, and the apex of each crystal may point towards the center of the cavity.\n\nThe priming layer is often dark green, but can be modified by iron oxide resulting in a rust like appearance. Agate is a very durable and therefore is often seen detached from its eroding matrix, once removed, the outer surface is usually pitted and rough from filling the cavity of its former matrix. Agates have also been found in sedimentary rocks, normally in limestone or dolomite; these sedimentary rocks acquire cavities often from decomposed branches or other buried organic material. If silica-rich fluids are able to penetrate into these cavities agates can be formed.\n\nTypes\n\nLace agate is a variety that exhibits a lace-like pattern with forms such as eyes, swirls, bands or zigzags. Blue lace agate is found in Africa and is especially hard. Crazy lace agate, typically found in Mexico, is often brightly colored with a complex pattern, demonstrating randomized distribution of contour lines and circular droplets, scattered throughout the rock. The stone is typically coloured red and white but is also seen to exhibit yellow and grey combinations as well.\n\nMoss agate, as the name suggests, exhibits a moss-like pattern and is of a greenish colour. The coloration is not created by any vegetative growth, but rather through the mixture of chalcedony and oxidized iron hornblende. Dendritic agate also displays vegetative features, including fern-like patterns formed due to the presence of manganese and iron oxides.\n\nTurritella agate (Elimia tenera) is formed from the shells of fossilized freshwater Turritella gastropods with elongated spiral shells. Similarly, coral, petrified wood, porous rocks and other organic remains can also form agate.\n\nColdwater agates, such as the Lake Michigan cloud agate, did not form under volcanic processes, but instead formed within the limestone and dolomite strata of marine origin. Like volcanic-origin agates, Coldwater agates formed from silica gels that lined pockets and seams within the bedrock. These agates are typically less colorful, with banded lines of grey and white chalcedony.\n\nGreek agate is a name given to pale white to tan colored agate found in the former Greek colony of Sicily as early as 400 BCE. The Greeks used it for making jewelry and beads.\n\nBrazilian agate is found as sizable geodes of layered nodules. These occur in brownish tones inter-layered with white and gray. It is often dyed in various colors for ornamental purposes.\n\nPolyhedroid agate forms in a flat-sided shape similar to a polyhedron. When sliced, it often shows a characteristic layering of concentric polygons. It has been suggested that growth is not crystallographically controlled but is due to the filling-in of spaces between pre-existing crystals which have since dissolved.\n\nOther forms of agate include Holley blue agate (also spelled \"Holly blue agate\"), a rare dark blue ribbon agate only found near Holley, Oregon; Lake Superior agate; Carnelian agate (has reddish hues); Botswana agate; plume agate; condor agate; tube agate containing visible flow channels or pinhole-sized \"tubes\"; fortification agate with contrasting concentric banding reminiscent of defensive ditches and walls around ancient forts; Binghamite, a variety found only on the Cuyuna iron range (near Crosby) in Crow Wing County, Minnesota; fire agate showing an iridescent, internal flash or \"fire\", the result of a layer of clear agate over a layer of hydrothermally deposited hematite; Patuxent River stone, a red and yellow form of agate only found in Maryland; enhydro agate contains tiny inclusions of water, sometimes with air bubbles.\n\nUses in industry and art\n\nIndustrial uses of agate exploit its hardness, ability to retain a highly polished surface finish and resistance to chemical attack. It has traditionally been used to make knife-edge bearings for laboratory balances and precision pendulums, and sometimes to make mortars and pestles to crush and mix chemicals. It has also been used for centuries for leather burnishing tools.\n\nThe decorative arts use it to make ornaments such as pins, brooches or other types of jewellery, paper knives, inkstands, marbles and seals. Agate is also still used today for decorative displays, cabochons, beads, carvings and Intarsia art as well as face-polished and tumble-polished specimens of varying size and origin. Idar-Oberstein was one of the centers which made use of agate on an industrial scale. Where in the beginning locally found agates were used to make all types of objects for the European market, this became a globalized business around the turn of the 20th century: Idar-Oberstein imported large quantities of agate from Brazil, as ship's ballast. Making use of a variety of proprietary chemical processes, they produced colored beads that were sold around the globe. Agates have long been used in arts and crafts. The sanctuary of a Presbyterian church in Yachats, Oregon, has six windows with panes made of agates collected from the local beaches.\n\nHealth impact\nRespiratory diseases such as silicosis and higher incidence of tuberculosis among workers involved in the agate industry have been reported from India and China.\n\nSee also\n\n Topaz\n Opal\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Cross, Brad L. and Zeitner, June Culp.

He was a son of king Alaric II and his first wife Theodegotha, daughter of Theoderic the Great.\n\nBiography\nWhen Alaric II was killed while fighting Clovis I, king of the Franks, in the Battle of Vouill\u00e9 (507), his kingdom fell into disarray. \"More serious than the destruction of the Gothic army,\" writes Herwig Wolfram, \"than the loss of both Aquitanian provinces and the capital of Toulose, was the death of the king.\" Alaric had made no provision for a successor, and although he had two sons, one was of age but illegitimate and the other, Amalaric, the offspring of a legal marriage but still a child.  Amalaric was carried for safety into Spain, which country and Provence were thenceforth ruled by his maternal grandfather, Theodoric the Great, acting through his vice-regent, an Ostrogothic nobleman named Theudis. The older son, Gesalec, was chosen as king but his reign was disastrous. King Theoderic of the Ostrogoths sent an army, led by his sword-bearer Theudis, against Gesalec, ostensibly on behalf of Amalaric; Gesalec fled to Africa. The Ostrogoths then drove back the Franks and their Burgundian allies, regaining possession of \"the south of Novempopulana, Rodez, probably even Albi, and even Toulose\". Following the 511 death of Clovis, Theoderic negotiated a peace with Clovis' successors, securing Visigothic control of the southernmost portion of Gaul for the rest of the existence of their kingdom.\n\nIn 522, the young Amalaric was proclaimed king, and four years later, on Theoderic's death, he assumed full royal power, although relinquishing Provence to his cousin Athalaric. His kingdom was faced with a Frankish threat from the north; according to Peter Heather, this was his motivation for marrying Chrotilda, the daughter of Clovis. However, this was not successful, for according to Gregory of Tours, Amalaric pressured her to forsake Orthodoxy and convert to Arian Christianity, at one point beating her until she bled; she sent to her brother Childebert I, king of Paris, a towel stained with her own blood. It is worth noting Ian Wood's advice that although Gregory provides the fullest information for this period, where it touches Merovingian affairs, he often \"allowed his religious bias to determine his interpretation of the events.\" Peter Heather agrees with Wood's implication in this instance: \"I doubt that this is the full story, but the effects of Frankish intervention are clear enough.\"\n\nChildebert defeated the Visigothic army and took Narbonne. Amalaric fled south to Barcelona, where according to Isidore of Seville, he was assassinated by his own men. According to Peter Heather, Theoderic's former governor Theudis was implicated in Amalaric's murder, \"and was certainly its prime beneficiary.\" As for Chrotilda, in Gregory's words, she died on the journey home \"by some ill chance\". Childebert had her body brought to Paris where she was buried alongside her father Clovis.\n\nExternal Links\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\nEdward Gibbon, History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter 39\n\n531 deaths\nBalt dynasty\nAssassinated Gothic people\n6th-century murdered monarchs\n6th-century Visigothic monarchs\nYear of birth unknown", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "3305", "entropy": "4.55928823131072", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.502720677146312", "brevity_score": "0.0031545741324920983"}
{"text": "Arcology, a portmanteau of \"architecture\" and \"ecology\", is a field of creating architectural design principles for very densely populated and ecologically low-impact human habitats.\n\nThe term was coined in 1969 by architect Paolo Soleri, who believed that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human environmental impact. These structures have been largely hypothetical, as no arcology, even one envisioned by Soleri himself, has yet been built.\n\nThe concept has been popularized by various science fiction writers. Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle provided a detailed description of an arcology in their 1981 novel Oath of Fealty. William Gibson mainstreamed the term in his seminal 1984 cyberpunk novel Neuromancer, where each corporation has its own self-contained city known as arcologies. More recently, authors such as Peter Hamilton in Neutronium Alchemist and Paolo Bacigalupi in The Water Knife explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios. They are often portrayed as self-contained or economically self-sufficient.\n\nDevelopment\nAn arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the impact of human habitation on any given ecosystem. It could be self-sustainable, employing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life: power, climate control, food production, air and water conservation and purification, sewage treatment, etc. An arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for a large population. An arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own.\n\nArcology was proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven, post-automobile, to be difficult to achieve in other ways.\n\nFrank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version called Broadacre City although, in contrast to an arcology, his idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network. Wright's plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics said that Wright's solution failed to account for population growth, and assumed a more rigid democracy than the US actually has.\n\nBuckminster Fuller proposed the Old Man River's City project, a domed city with a capacity of 125,000, as a solution to the housing problems in East St. Louis, Illinois.\n\nPaolo Soleri proposed later solutions, and coined the term \"arcology\". Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, to economize on transportation and other energy uses. Like Wright, Soleri proposed changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce. Soleri explored reductions in resource consumption and duplication, land reclamation; he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation. He advocated for greater \"frugality\" and favored greater use of shared social resources, including public transit (and public libraries).\n\nSimilar real-world projects\n\nArcosanti is an experimental \"arcology prototype\", a demonstration project under construction in central Arizona since 1970. Designed by Paolo Soleri, its primary purpose is to demonstrate Soleri's personal designs, his application of principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly urban form.\n\nMany cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept, like Tokyo, and  Dongtan near Shanghai. The Dongtan project may have collapsed, and it failed to open for the Shanghai World Expo in 2010.\n\nMcMurdo Station of the United States Antarctic Program and other scientific research stations on Antarctica resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, relatively self-sufficient human community. The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character. The station is not self-sufficientthe U.S. military delivers 30,000 cubic metres (8,000,000 US gal) of fuel and  of supplies and equipment yearly through its Operation Deep Freeze resupply effortbut it is isolated from conventional support networks. Under international treaty, it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem.\n\nBegich Towers operates like a small-scale arcology encompassing nearly all of the population of Whittier, Alaska. The building contains residential housing as well as a police station, grocery, and municipal offices.\nWhittier once boasted a second structure known as the Buckner Building. The Buckner Building still stands but was deemed unfit for habitation after the 1969 earthquake.\n\nIn popular culture\nMost proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural or conceptual shortcomings. Arcologies are therefore found primarily in fictional works.\n\n In Robert Silverberg's The World Inside, most of the global population of 75 billion live inside giant skyscrapers, called \"urbmons\", each of which contains hundreds of thousands of people. The urbmons are arranged in \"constellations\". Each urbmon is divided into \"neighborhoods\" of 40 or so floors. All the needs of the inhabitants are provided inside the building \u2013 food is grown outside and brought into the building \u2013 so the idea of going outside is heretical and can be a sign of madness. The book examines human life when the population density is extremely high.\n Another significant example is the 1981 novel Oath of Fealty by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, in which a segment of the population of Los Angeles has moved into an arcology. The plot examines the social changes that result, both inside and outside the arcology. Thus the arcology is not just a plot device but a subject of critique.\n In the city-building video game Sim City 2000, self-contained arcologies can be built, reducing the infrastructure needs of the city.\n\nSee also\n\n Autonomous building\n Bionic architecture\n Earthship\n Megastructure\n Proposed tall buildings and structures\n Shimizu Mega-City Pyramid\n Underground city\n Urban ecology\n Vertical farming\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n Soleri, Paolo.

{"text": "Anbar (, ,) also known by its original ancient name, Peroz-Shapur, was an ancient and medieval town in central Iraq. It played a role in the Roman\u2013Persian Wars of the 3rd\u20134th centuries, and briefly became the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate before the founding of Baghdad in 762. It remained a moderately prosperous town through the 10th century, but quickly declined thereafter. As a local administrative centre, it survived until the 14th century, but was later abandoned.\n\nIts ruins are near modern Fallujah. The city gives its name to the Al-Anbar Governorate.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins \n\nThe city is located on the left bank of the Middle Euphrates, at the junction with the Nahr Isa canal, the first of the navigable canals that link the Euphrates to the River Tigris to the east. The origins of the city are unknown, but ancient, perhaps dating to the Babylonian era and even earlier: the local artificial mound of Tell Aswad dates to .\n\nSasanian period \nThe town was originally known as Misiche (Greek: ), Mesiche (), or Massice ( m\u0161yk;  m\u0161yk). As a major crossing point of the Euphrates, and occupying the northernmost point of the complex irrigation network of the Sawad, the town was of considerable strategic significance. As the western gate to central Mesopotamia, it was fortified by the Sasanian ruler Shapur I () to shield his capital, Ctesiphon, from the Roman Empire. After his decisive defeat of the Roman emperor Gordian III at the Battle of Misiche in 244, Shapur renamed the town to Peroz-Shapur (P\u0113r\u014dz-\u0160\u0101p\u016br or P\u0113r\u014dz-\u0160\u0101buhr, from , meaning \"victorious Shapur\"; in ; in ). It became known as Pirisapora or Bersabora () to the Greeks and Romans.\n\nThe city was fortified by a double wall, possibly through the use of Roman prisoner labour; it was sacked and burned after an agreement with its garrison in March 363 by the Roman emperor Julian during his invasion of the Sasanian Empire. It was rebuilt by Shapur II. By 420, it is attested as a bishopric, both for the Church of the East and for the Syriac Orthodox Church. The town's garrison was Persian, but it also contained sizeable Arab and Jewish populations. Anbar was adjacent or identical to the Babylonian Jewish center of Nehardea (), and lies a short distance from the present-day town of Fallujah, formerly the Babylonian Jewish center of Pumbedita ().\n\nIslamic period \nThe city fell to the Rashidun Caliphate in July 633, after a fiercely fought siege. The Arabs retained the name (F\u012br\u016bz Sh\u0101b\u016br) for the surrounding district, but the town itself became known as Anbar (Middle Persian word for \"granary\" or \"storehouse\") from the granaries in its citadel, a name that had appeared already during the 6th century. According to Baladhuri, the third mosque to be built in Iraq was erected in the city by Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas. Ibn Abi Waqqas initially considered Anbar as a candidate for the location of one of the first Muslim garrison towns, but the fever and fleas endemic in the area persuaded him otherwise.\n\nAccording to medieval Arabic sources, most of the inhabitants of the town migrated north to found the city of Hdatta south of Mosul. The famous governor al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf cleared the canals of the city.\n\nAbu'l-Abbas as-Saffah (), the founder of the Abbasid Caliphate, made it his capital in 752, constructing a new town half a farsakh () to the north for his Khurasani troops. There he died and was buried at the palace he had built. His successor, al-Mansur (), remained in the city until the founding of Baghdad in 762. The Abbasids also dug the great Nahr Isa canal to the south of the city, which carried water and commerce east to Baghdad. Thee Nahr al-Saqlawiyya or Nahr al-Qarma canal, which branches off from the Euphrates to the west of the city, is sometimes erroneously held to be the Nahr Isa, but it is more likely that it is to be identified with the pre-Islamic Nahr al-Rufayl.\n\nIt continued to be a place of much importance throughout the Abbasid period. Caliph Harun al-Rashid () stayed at the town in 799 and in 803. The town's prosperity was founded on agricultural activities, but also on trade between Iraq and Syria. The town was still prosperous in the early 9th century, but the decline of Abbasid authority during the later 9th century exposed it to Bedouin attacks in 882 and 899. In 927, the Qarmatians under Abu Tahir al-Jannabi sacked the city, and the devastation was compounded by another Bedouin attack two years later. The town's decline accelerated after that: while the early 10th-century geographer Istakhri still calls the town modest but populous, with the ruins of the buildings of as-Saffah still visible, Ibn Hawqal and al-Maqdisi, who wrote a generation later, attest to its decline, and the diminution of its population.\n\nThe town was sacked again in 1262 by the Mongols under Kerboka. The Ilkhanids retained Anbar as an administrative centre, a role it retained until the first half of the 14th century; the Ilkhanid minister Shams al-Din Juvayni had a canal dug from the city to Najaf, and the city was surrounded by a wall of sun-dried bricks.\n\nEcclesiastical history \nAnbar used to host an Assyrian community from the fifth century: the town was the seat of a bishopric of the Church of the East. The names of fourteen of its bishops of the period 486\u20131074 are known, three of whom became Chaldean Patriarchs of Babylon.\n Narses \n Simeon \n Salibazachi \n Paul \n Theodosius \n John \n Enos 890\n Elias \n Jaballaha \n Sebarjesus\n Elias II \n Unnamed bishop \n Mundar \n Maris \n Zacharias\n\nTitular see \nAnbar is listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see of the Chaldean Catholic Church, established as titular bishopric in 1980.\n \nIt has had the following incumbents:\n Titular Archbishop St\u00e9phane Katchou (1980.10.03 \u2013 1981.11.10), as Coadjutor Archeparch of Bassorah of the Chaldeans (Iraq) (1980.10.03 \u2013 1981.11.10)\n Titular Bishop Ibrahim Namo Ibrahim (1982.01.11 \u2013 1985.08.03), as Apostolic Exarch in the United States of America (1982.01.11 \u2013 1985.08.03)\n Titular Bishop Shlemon Warduni (since 2001.01.12), Curial Bishop of the Chaldean Catholic Church\n\nToday \nIt is now entirely deserted, occupied only by mounds of ruins, whose great number indicate the city's former importance.

{"text": "An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting or participating in extreme sports. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained in a risky manner.\n\nMotivation\nAdventurous experiences create psychological arousal, which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. fear) or positive (e.g. flow).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer Andr\u00e9 Malraux, in his La Condition Humaine (1933), \"If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?\".\n\nSimilarly, Helen Keller stated that \"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.\"\n\nOutdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers \u2013 the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.\n\nAuthor Jon Levy suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure:\n\n Be remarkable\u2014that is, worth talking about\n Involve adversity or perceived risk\n Bring about personal growth\n\nMythology and fiction\nSome of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's The Odyssey.\n\nThe knight errant was the form the \"adventure seeker\" character took in the late Middle Ages.\n\nThe adventure novel exhibits these \"protagonist on adventurous journey\" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nOutdoors\nAdventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or Mother Nature. Examples include books such as Hatchet or My Side of the Mountain. These books are less about \"questing\", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.\n\nQuesting\nMany adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, treasure, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles to obtain their reward.\n\nVideo games\n\nIn video-game culture, an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and  puzzle-solving. The genre's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media, literature and film, encompassing a wide variety of literary genres. Many adventure games (text and graphic) are designed for a single player, since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult.\n\nNonfiction works\nFrom ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as Marco Polo's journal The Travels of Marco Polo or Mark Twain's Roughing It. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of Lewis and Clark or Captain James Cook's journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as Conquistadors of the Useless by Lionel Terray. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.\n\nAdventure sports \n\nThere are many sports classified as adventure games or sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include mountain climbing, skydiving, or other extreme sports.Adventure sports has fast caught up in the Indian milieu. India offers immense opportunity for adventure lovers throughout its length and breadth. Angling & Fishing are two remarkable adventure activities among the many others that are offered in India. They are specially suited to the Indian subcontinent because of innumerable rivers that course through the expansive Gangetic Plains, and originate in the upper reaches of the magnificent Himalayas. The Indian Himalaya are an ultimate destination for adventure lovers and has attracted trekkers and lovers of nature Indian himalayas are the source of significant life giver rivers, like Ganges Beas, Satluj and their tributaries. The Himalayan mountain ranges of India offer breathtaking, highly challenging trekking routes. Mountaineering in India was introduced by the Europeans in the 18th century. India offers an exciting mountaineering experience to an adventure sport lover. The Himalayas that stretch from north-west of India to far north-east offers a number of high rise peaks that are considered ideal for mountaineering. Some of the places for mountaineering in India are Leh Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir, Garhwal and Kumaon Himalayas in Uttarakhand, Kullu valley and Lahul Spiti in Himachal Pradesh, and Sikkim and some other parts of north-eastern region.\n\nSee also\n\n Adventure film\n Adventure playground\n Adventure travel\n Exploration\n List of genres\n Sports\n Tourism\n Travel\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Martin Feeney Going on a journey: Life in Year 10\n Website of the Research Unit \"Philology of Adventure\": ongoing research project on the literary history of the adventure pattern\n What is an adventure?

{"text": "Audio signal processing is a subfield of signal processing that is concerned with the electronic manipulation of audio signals. Audio signals are electronic representations of sound waves\u2014longitudinal waves which travel through air, consisting of compressions and rarefactions. The energy contained in audio signals is typically measured in decibels.  As audio signals may be represented in either digital or analog format, processing may occur in either domain.  Analog processors operate directly on the electrical signal, while digital processors operate mathematically on its digital representation.\n\nHistory \nThe motivation for audio signal processing began at the beginning of the 20th century with inventions like the telephone, phonograph, and radio that allowed for the transmission and storage of audio signals. Audio processing was necessary for early radio broadcasting, as there were many problems with studio-to-transmitter links. The theory of signal processing and its application to audio was largely developed at Bell Labs in the mid 20th century. Claude Shannon and Harry Nyquist's early work on communication theory, sampling theory and pulse-code modulation (PCM) laid the foundations for the field. In 1957, Max Mathews became the first person to synthesize audio from a computer, giving birth to computer music.\n\nMajor developments in digital audio coding and audio data compression include differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) by C. Chapin Cutler at Bell Labs in 1950, linear predictive coding (LPC) by Fumitada Itakura (Nagoya University) and Shuzo Saito (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone) in 1966, adaptive DPCM (ADPCM) by P. Cummiskey, Nikil S. Jayant and James L. Flanagan at Bell Labs in 1973, discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding by Nasir Ahmed, T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao in 1974, and modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) coding by J. P. Princen, A. W. Johnson and A. B. Bradley at the University of Surrey in 1987. LPC is the basis for perceptual coding and is widely used in speech coding, while MDCT coding is widely used in modern audio coding formats such as MP3 and Advanced Audio Coding (AAC).\n\nAnalog signals \n\nAn analog audio signal is a continuous signal represented by an electrical voltage or current that is analogous to the sound waves in the air. Analog signal processing then involves physically altering the continuous signal by changing the voltage or current or charge via electrical circuits.\n\nHistorically, before the advent of widespread digital technology, analog was the only method by which to manipulate a signal. Since that time, as computers and software have become more capable and affordable, digital signal processing has become the method of choice. However, in music applications, analog technology is often still desirable as it often produces nonlinear responses that are difficult to replicate with digital filters.\n\nDigital signals \n\nA digital representation expresses the audio waveform as a sequence of symbols, usually binary numbers.  This permits signal processing using digital circuits such as digital signal processors, microprocessors and general-purpose computers.  Most modern audio systems use a digital approach as the techniques of digital signal processing are much more powerful and efficient than analog domain signal processing.\n\nApplications \n\nProcessing methods and application areas include storage, data compression, music information retrieval, speech processing, localization, acoustic detection, transmission, noise cancellation, acoustic fingerprinting, sound recognition, synthesis, and enhancement (e.g. equalization, filtering, level compression, echo and reverb removal or addition, etc.).\n\nAudio broadcasting \n\nAudio signal processing is used when broadcasting audio signals in order to enhance their fidelity or optimize for bandwidth or latency. In this domain, the most important audio processing takes place just before the transmitter. The audio processor here must prevent or minimize overmodulation, compensate for non-linear transmitters (a potential issue with medium wave and shortwave broadcasting), and adjust overall loudness to desired level.\n\nActive noise control \n\nActive noise control is a technique designed to reduce unwanted sound. By creating a signal that is identical to the unwanted noise but with the opposite polarity, the two signals cancel out due to destructive interference.\n\nAudio synthesis \n\nAudio synthesis is the electronic generation of audio signals. A musical instrument that accomplishes this is called a synthesizer. Synthesizers can either imitate sounds or generate new ones. Audio synthesis is also used to generate human speech using speech synthesis.\n\nAudio effects\n\nAudio effects alter the sound of a musical instrument or other audio source. Common effects include distortion, often used with electric guitar in electric blues and rock music; dynamic effects such as volume pedals and compressors, which affect loudness; filters such as wah-wah pedals and graphic equalizers, which modify frequency ranges; modulation effects, such as chorus, flangers and phasers; pitch effects such as pitch shifters; and time effects, such as reverb and delay, which create echoing sounds and emulate the sound of different spaces.\n\nMusicians, audio engineers and record producers use effects units during live performances or in the studio, typically with electric guitar, bass guitar, electronic keyboard or electric piano. While effects are most frequently used with electric or electronic instruments, they can be used with any audio source, such as acoustic instruments, drums, and vocals.\n\nSee also \n Sound card\n Sound effect\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n\nAudio electronics\nSignal processing", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "5740", "entropy": "4.465938196412537", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4216300940438871", "brevity_score": "0.0022421524663677117"}
{"text": "Parc G\u00fcell ( ; ) is a privatized park system composed of gardens and architectural elements located on Carmel Hill, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of Collserola \u2013 the Parc del Carmel is located on the northern face. Park G\u00fcell is located in La Salut, a neighborhood in the Gr\u00e0cia district of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind, Eusebi G\u00fcell assigned the design of the park to Antoni Gaud\u00ed, a renowned architect and the face of Catalan modernism.\n\nThe park was built from 1900 to 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, UNESCO declared the park a World Heritage Site under \"Works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed\".\n\nDescription\n\nPark G\u00fcell is the reflection of Gaud\u00ed's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his naturalist phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park G\u00fcell, Gaud\u00ed unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family (Catalan: Sagrada Familia).\n\nG\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by symbolism, since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political Catalanism \u2013  especially in the entrance stairway where the Catalan countries are represented \u2013 and from Catholicism \u2013 the Monumento al Calvario, originally designed to be a chapel. The mythological elements are so important: apparently G\u00fcell and Gaud\u00ed's conception of the park was also inspired by the Temple of Apollo of Delphi.\n\nOn the other hand, many experts have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex iconography that Gaud\u00ed applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to religious exaltation, passing through mythology, history and philosophy. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to Freemasonry, despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaud\u00ed and Count G\u00fcell. These references have not been proven in the historiography of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park G\u00fcell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and puzzles.\n\nOrigins as a housing development\n\nThe park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count Eusebi G\u00fcell, after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English garden city movement; hence the original English name Park (in Catalan the name is \"Parc G\u00fcell\"). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called Muntanya Pelada (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House and was next to a neighbourhood of upper-class houses called La Salut (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi G\u00fcell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaud\u00ed. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaud\u00ed, at G\u00fcell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906. This house, where Gaud\u00ed lived from 1906 to 1926 (his death), was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaud\u00ed and several of his collaborators. It is now the Gaud\u00ed House Museum (Casa Museu Gaud\u00ed) since 1963. In 1969, it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.\n\nMunicipal garden \n\nIt has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaud\u00ed's house, \"la Torre Rosa,\" \u2013 containing furniture that he designed \u2013 can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaud\u00ed's house and the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Church.\n\nPark G\u00fcell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaud\u00ed. These two buildings make up the Porter's Lodge pavilion. One of these buildings contains a small room with a telephone booth.  The other, while once being the porter's house, is now a permanent exhibition of the Barcelona City History Museum MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.\n\nThe focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a sea serpent. The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaud\u00ed incorporated many motifs of Catalan nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaud\u00ed but of his often overlooked collaborator Josep Maria Jujol.\n\nRoadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaud\u00ed as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaud\u00ed designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching vaulting under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell so that the inverted catenary arch shapes form perfect compression structures.\n\nAt the park's high-point, there is a stone hill composed of steps leading up to a platform which holds three large crosses. The official name of this is \"El Tur\u00f3 de les Tres Creus,\" however many tourists choose to call it Calvary. Two of the crosses point north\u2013south and east\u2013west, the third, and tallest cross, points skyward. This lookout offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (another one of Antoni Guad\u00ed's famous creations), the Agbar Tower, and the Montju\u00efc area visible at a distance.\n\nThe park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of parrot found in the Barcelona area. Other birds can be seen from the park, with records including short-toed eagle. The park also supports a population of hummingbird hawk moths.\n\nGallery of images\n\nSee also\n List of Modernisme buildings in Barcelona\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Park Guell website\n\nAntoni Gaud\u00ed buildings\nBuildings and structures completed in 1914\nBuildings and structures in Barcelona\nCulture in Barcelona\nModernisme architecture in Barcelona\nMosaics\nGr\u00e0cia\nGuell\nVisionary environments\nAzulejos in buildings in Catalonia\nTourist attractions in Barcelona\nWorld Heritage Sites in Catalonia", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "8397", "entropy": "4.520290251406396", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.4525892646015606", "brevity_score": "0.0014705882352941061"}
{"text": "Allotropy or allotropism () is the property of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state, known as allotropes of the elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element: the atoms of the element are bonded together in a different manner.\nFor example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (the carbon atoms are bonded together to form a cubic lattice of tetrahedra), graphite (the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal lattice), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations).\n\nThe term allotropy is used for elements only, not for compounds. The more general term, used for any compound, is polymorphism, although its use is usually restricted to solid materials such as crystals. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same physical phase (the state of matter, such as a solid, liquid or gas). The differences between these states of matter would not alone constitute examples of allotropy. Allotropes of chemical elements are frequently referred to as polymorphs or  as phases of the element. \n\nFor some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae or different crystalline structures, as well as a difference in physical phase; for example, two allotropes of oxygen (dioxygen, O2, and ozone, O3) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different physical phases; for example, phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes, which all revert to the same P4 form when melted to the liquid state.\n\nHistory\nThe concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1840 by the Swedish scientist Baron J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius (1779\u20131848). The term is derived . After the acceptance of Avogadro's hypothesis in 1860, it was understood that elements could exist as polyatomic molecules, and two allotropes of oxygen were recognized as O2 and O3. In the early 20th century, it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure.\n\nBy 1912, Ostwald noted that the allotropy of elements is just a special case of the phenomenon of polymorphism known for compounds, and proposed that the terms allotrope and allotropy be abandoned and replaced by polymorph and polymorphism. Although many other chemists have repeated this advice, IUPAC and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only.\n\nDifferences in properties of an element's allotropes\nAllotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e., pressure, light, and temperature. Therefore, the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, iron  changes from a body-centered cubic structure (ferrite) to a face-centered cubic structure (austenite) above 906\u00a0\u00b0C, and tin undergoes a modification known as tin pest from a metallic form to a semiconductor form below 13.2\u00a0\u00b0C (55.8\u00a0\u00b0F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O3) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O2).\n\nList of allotropes\nTypically, elements capable of variable coordination number and/or oxidation states tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms. Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to catenate.\n\nExamples of allotropes include:\n\nNon-metals\n\nMetalloids\n\nMetals\n\nAmong the metallic elements that occur in nature in significant quantities (56 up to U, without Tc and Pm), almost half (27) are allotropic at ambient pressure: Li, Be, Na, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Sr, Y, Zr, Sn, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Yb, Hf, Tl, Th, Pa and U. Some phase transitions between allotropic forms of technologically relevant metals are those of Ti at 882\u00a0\u00b0C, Fe at 912\u00a0\u00b0C and 1394\u00a0\u00b0C, Co at 422\u00a0\u00b0C, Zr at 863\u00a0\u00b0C, Sn at 13\u00a0\u00b0C and U at 668\u00a0\u00b0C and 776\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\nLanthanides and actinides\n\n Cerium, samarium, dysprosium and ytterbium have three allotropes.\n Praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium  and terbium have two allotropes.\n Plutonium has six distinct solid allotropes under \"normal\" pressures. Their densities vary within a ratio of some 4:3, which vastly complicates all kinds of work with the metal (particularly casting, machining, and storage). A seventh plutonium allotrope exists at very high pressures. The transuranium metals Np, Am, and Cm are also allotropic.\n Promethium, americium, berkelium and californium have three allotropes each.\n\nNanoallotropes \nIn 2017, the concept of nanoallotropy was proposed by Prof. Rafal Klajn of the Organic Chemistry Department of the Weizmann Institute of Science. Nanoallotropes, or allotropes of nanomaterials, are nanoporous materials that have the same chemical composition (e.g., Au), but differ in their architecture at the nanoscale (that is, on a scale 10 to 100 times the dimensions of individual atoms). Such nanoallotropes may help create ultra-small electronic devices and find other industrial applications. The different nanoscale architectures translate into different properties, as was demonstrated for surface-enhanced Raman scattering performed on several different nanoallotropes of gold. A two-step method for generating nanoallotropes was also created.\n\nSee also\nIsomer\nPolymorphism (materials science)\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAllotropes \u2013 Chemistry Encyclopedia\n\n \nChemistry\nInorganic chemistry\nPhysical chemistry", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "5651", "entropy": "4.557142162959825", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.44188094399436423", "brevity_score": "0.002105263157894752"}
{"text": "The politics of Armenia take place in the framework of the parliamentary representative democratic republic of Armenia, whereby the President of Armenia is the head of state and the Prime Minister of Armenia the head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the President and the Government. Legislative power is vested in both the Government and Parliament.\n\nHistory\nArmenia became independent from the Russian Empire on 28 May 1918 as the Republic of Armenia, later referred as First Republic of Armenia. About a month before its independence Armenia was part of short lived Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic. Suffering heavy losses during the Turkish invasion of Armenia and after the Soviet invasion of Armenia, the government of the First Republic resigned on 2 December 1920. Soviet Russia reinstalled its control over the country, which later became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR. The TSFSR was dissolved in 1936 and Armenia became a constituent republic of the Soviet Union known as the Armenian SSR, later also referred as the Second Republic of Armenia.\n\nDuring the dissolution of the Soviet Union the population of Armenia voted overwhelmingly for independence following the 1991 Armenian independence referendum. It was followed by a presidential election in October 1991 that gave 83% of the votes to Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Earlier in 1990, when the National Democratic Union party defeated the Armenian Communist Party, he was elected Chairman of the Supreme Council of Armenia. Ter-Petrosyan was re-elected in 1996. Following public discontent and demonstrations against his policies on Nagorno-Karabakh, the President resigned in January 1998 and was replaced by Prime Minister Robert Kocharyan, who was elected as second President in March 1998. Following the assassination of Prime Minister Vazgen Sargsyan, parliament Speaker Karen Demirchyan and six other officials during parliament seating on 27 October 1999, a period of political instability ensued during which an opposition headed by elements of the former Armenian National Movement government attempted unsuccessfully to force Kocharyan to resign. In May 2000, Andranik Margaryan replaced Aram Sargsyan (a brother of assassinated Vazgen Sargsyan) as Prime Minister.\n\nKocharyan's re-election as president in 2003 was followed by widespread allegations of ballot-rigging. He went on to propose controversial constitutional amendments on the role of parliament. These were rejected in a referendum the following May. Concurrent parliamentary elections left Kocharyan's party in a very powerful position in the parliament. There were mounting calls for the President's resignation in early 2004 with thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets in support of demands for a referendum of confidence in him.\n\nThe Government of Armenia's stated aim is to build a Western-style parliamentary democracy. However, international observers have questioned the fairness of Armenia's parliamentary and presidential elections and constitutional referendum between 1995 and 2018, citing polling deficiencies, lack of cooperation by the Electoral Commission, and poor maintenance of electoral lists and polling places. Armenia is considered one of the most democratic nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States.\n\nThe observance of human rights in Armenia is uneven and is marked by shortcomings. Police brutality allegedly still goes largely unreported, while observers note that defendants are often beaten to extract confessions and are denied visits from relatives and lawyers. Public demonstrations usually take place without government interference, though one rally in November 2000 by an opposition party was followed by the arrest and imprisonment for a month of its organizer. Freedom of religion is not always protected under existing law. Nontraditional churches, especially the Jehovah's Witnesses, have been subjected to harassment, sometimes violently. All churches apart from the Armenian Apostolic Church must register with the government, and proselytizing was forbidden by law, though since 1997 the government has pursued more moderate policies. The government's policy toward conscientious objection is in transition, as part of Armenia's accession to the Council of Europe.\n\nArmenia boasts a good record on the protection of national minorities, for whose representatives (Assyrians, Kurds, Russians and Yazidis) four seats are reserved in the National Assembly. The government does not restrict internal or international travel.\n\nTransition to a parliamentary republic\nIn December 2015, the country held a referendum which approved transformation of Armenia from a semi-presidential to a parliamentary republic.\n\nAs a result, the president was stripped of his veto faculty and the presidency was downgraded to a figurehead position elected by parliament every seven years. The president is not allowed to be a member of any political party and re-election is forbidden.\n\nSkeptics saw the constitutional reform as an attempt of third president Serzh Sargsyan to remain in control by becoming Prime Minister after fulfilling his second presidential term in 2018.\n\nIn March 2018, Armenian parliament elected Armen Sarksyan as the new President of Armenia. The controversial constitutional reform to reduce presidential power was implemented, while the authority of the prime minister was strengthened. In May 2018, parliament elected opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan as the new prime minister. His predecessor Serzh Sargsyan resigned two weeks earlier following widespread anti-government demonstrations.\n\nIn June 2021, early parliamentary elections were held. Nikol Pashinyan's Civil Contract party won 71 seats, while 29 went to a bloc headed by former President Robert Kocharyan. A different bloc that formed around another former president, Serzh Sargsyan, won seven seats. After the election, Armenia's acting Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was officially appointed to the post of prime minister by the country's president Armen Sarkissian. In January 2022, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian resigned from office, stating that the constitution does no longer give the president sufficient powers or influence.\n\nGovernment\n\n|President\n|Armen Sarkissian\n|Independent\n|9 April 2018\n|-\n|Prime Minister\n|Nikol Pashinyan\n|Civil Contract\n|8 May 2018\n|}\n\nLegislative branch\n\nThe unicameral National Assembly of Armenia (Azgayin Zhoghov) is the legislative branch of the government of Armenia.\n\nBefore the 2015 Armenian constitutional referendum, it was initially made of 131 members, elected for five-year terms: 41 members in single-seat constituencies and 90 by proportional representation. The proportional-representation seats in the National Assembly are assigned on a party-list basis among those parties that receive at least 5% of the total of the number of the votes.\n\nFollowing the 2015 referendum, the number of MPs was reduced from the original 131 members to 101 and single-seat constituencies were removed.\n\nPolitical parties and elections\n\nThe electoral threshold is currently set at 5% for single parties and 7% for blocs.\n\nLatest national elections\n\nLatest presidential elections\n\nIndependent agencies\n\nIndependent of three traditional branches are the following independent agencies, each with separate powers and responsibilities:\n\n the Constitutional Court of Armenia\n the Central Electoral Commission of Armenia\n the Human Rights Defender of Armenia\n the Central Bank of Armenia\n the General Prosecutor's Office\n the Audit Chamber of Armenia\n\nCorruption\n\nArmenia has seen substantive improvement in corruption over the past decade or so. In 2008, Transparency International reduced its Corruption Perceptions Index for Armenia from 3.0 in 2007 to 2.9 out of 10 (a lower score means more perceived corruption); Armenia slipped from 99th place in 2007 to 109th out of 180 countries surveyed (on a par with Argentina, Belize, Moldova, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu).\n\nHowever, Transparency International's 2020 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Armenia 60th in the world with 49 points - an increase by 7 points compared to 2019. According to Transparency International, Armenia has improved significantly on the Corruption Perception Index, rising 15 points since 2012. With that, \"Armenia has taken a gradual approach to reform, resulting in steady and positive improvements in anti-corruption. However, safeguarding judicial independence and ensuring checks and balances remain critical first steps in its anti-corruption efforts. The effectiveness of those efforts is additionally challenged by the current political and economic crisis as a result of the recent Nagorno Karabakh conflict and the subsequent protests against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan over a ceasefire deal\".\n\nSee also\n Constitution of Armenia\n Constitutional economics\n Elections in Armenia\n Foreign relations of Armenia\n List of political parties in Armenia\n Politics of Artsakh\n Programs of political parties in Armenia\n Rule according to higher law\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Global Integrity Report: Armenia has information on anti-corruption efforts\n Petrosyan, David: \"The Political System of Armenia: Form and Content\" in the Caucasus Analytical Digest No. 17\n Control Chamber of The Republic of Armenia\n Armenian language document\n National Assembly of the Republic of Armenia | Official Web Site | parliament.am", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "9462", "entropy": "4.558958861801956", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.40456563094483194", "brevity_score": "0.0014749262536873056"}
{"text": "In Greek mythology, Alcmene () or Alcmena (; Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03ba\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7 or Doric Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03ba\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1, Latin: Alcumena means \"strong in wrath\") was the wife of Amphitryon by whom she bore two children, Iphicles and Laonome. She is best known as the mother of Heracles, whose father was the god Zeus. Alcmene was also referred to as Electryone (\u1f28\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd\u03b7), a patronymic name as a daughter of Electryon.\n\nMythology\n\nBackground\nAccording to the Bibliotheca, Alcmene was born to Electryon, the son of Perseus and Andromeda, and king of Tiryns and Mycenae or Medea in Argolis. Her mother was Anaxo, daughter of Alcaeus and Astydamia. Other accounts say her mother was Lysidice, the daughter of Pelops and Hippodameia, or Eurydice the daughter of Pelops. According to Pausanias, the poet Asius made Alcmene the daughter of Amphiaraus and Eriphyle.\n\nHesiod describes Alcmene as the tallest, most beautiful woman with wisdom surpassed by no person born of mortal parents. It is said that her face and dark eyes were as charming as Aphrodite's, and that she honoured her husband like no woman before her.\n\nExile to Thebes\nAccording to the Bibliotheca, Alcmene went with Amphitryon to Thebes, where he was purified by Creon for accidentally killing Electryon. Alcmene refused to marry Amphitryon until he had avenged the death of her brothers. During Amphitryon's expedition against the Taphians and Teleboans, Zeus visited Alcmene disguised as Amphitryon. Zeus persuaded Alcmene that he was her husband. Extending one night into three, Zeus slept with Alcmene, his great-granddaughter, thereby conceiving Heracles, while recounting Amphitryon's victories against the Teleboans. When Amphitryon finally returned to Thebes, Alcmene told him that he had come the night before and slept with her; he learned from Tiresias what Zeus had done.\n\nBirth of Heracles\n\nHomer\nIn Homer's Iliad, when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by Zeus himself would be born and rule all those around him. Hera, after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from Olympus to Argos and made the wife of Sthenelus (son of Perseus) give birth to Eurystheus after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfillment of Zeus's oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles.\n\nOvid\nAccording to Ovid's Metamorphoses, while in labour, Alcmene was having great difficulty giving birth to such a large child. After seven days and nights of agony, Alcmene stretched out her arms and called upon Lucina, the goddess of childbirth (the Roman equivalent of Eileithyia). While Lucina did go to Alcmene, she had been previously instructed by Juno (Hera) to prevent the delivery. With her hands clasped and legs crossed, Lucina muttered charms, thereby preventing Alcmene from giving birth. Alcmene writhed in pain, cursed the heavens, and came close to death. Galanthis, a maid of Alcmene who was nearby, observed Lucina's behaviour and quickly deduced that it was Juno's doing. To put an end to her mistress's suffering, she announced that Alcmene had safely delivered her child, which surprised Lucina so much that she immediately jumped up and unclenched her hands. As soon as Lucina leapt up, Alcmene was released from her spell, and gave birth to Heracles. As punishment for deceiving Lucina, Galanthis was transformed into a weasel; she continued to live with Alcmene.\n\nPausanias\nIn Pausanias' recounting, Hera sent witches (as they were called by the Thebans) to hinder Alcmene's delivery of Heracles. The witches were successful in preventing the birth until Historis, daughter of Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches. Like Galanthis, Historis announced that Alcmene had delivered her child; having been deceived, the witches went away, allowing Alcmene to give birth.\n\nPlautus\nIn contrast to the depictions of a difficult labor above, an alternative version is presented in Amphitryon, a comedic play by Plautus. Here Alcmene calls upon Jupiter, who performs a miracle allowing her to give birth quickly and without pain. After a crash of thunder and light, the baby arrives without anyone's assistance.\n\nDeath\nAfter the death of Amphitryon, Alcmene married Rhadamanthys, son of Zeus, and lived with him in exile at Ocaleae in Boeotia. It is said that after Heracles was apotheosised, Hyllus, having pursued and killed Eurystheus, cut off Eurystheus' head and gave it to Alcmene, who gouged out the eyes with weaving pins. In Metamorphoses, an aging Alcmene recounted the story of the birth of Heracles to Iole.\n\nThere are two accounts of Alcmene's death. In the first, according to the Megarians, Alcmene was walking from Argos to Thebes when she died at Megara. The Heracleidae fell into disagreement about where to take Alcmene's body, with some wishing to take her corpse back to Argos, and others wishing to take it to Thebes to be buried with Amphitryon and Heracles' children by Megara. However, the god in Delphi gave the Heracleidae an oracle that it was better to bury Alcmene in Megara. In the second account given by the Thebans, when Alcmene died, she was turned from human form to a stone.\n\nPausanias indicated that an altar to Alcmene had been built in the Cynosarges in Athens, alongside altars to Heracles, Hebe, and Iolaus. Pausanias also said that Alcmene's tomb is located near the Olympieum at Megara.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nApollodorus.

{"text": "Transport in Antarctica has transformed from explorers crossing the isolated remote area of Antarctica by foot to a more open era due to human technologies enabling more convenient and faster transport, predominantly by air and water, but also by land as well. \nTransportation technologies on a remote area like Antarctica need to be able to deal with extremely low temperatures and continuous winds to ensure the travelers' safety. Due to the fragility of the Antarctic environment, only a limited amount of transport movements can take place and sustainable transportation technologies have to be used to reduce the ecological footprint.\nThe infrastructure of land, water and air transport needs to be safe and sustainable. \nCurrently thousands of tourists and hundreds of scientists a year depend on the Antarctic transportation system.\n\nLand transport\n\nRoads\n\nWinds continuously blow snow on roads in Antarctica.\n\nThe South Pole Traverse (McMurdo\u2013South Pole highway) is approximately  long and links the United States McMurdo Station on the coast to the Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station. It was constructed by leveling snow and in crevasses, but is not paved. There are flags to mark the road.\n\nAlso, the United States Antarctic Program maintains two ice roads during the austral summer. One provides access to Pegasus Field on the Ross Ice Shelf. The ice road between Pegasus Field and McMurdo Station is about . The other road provides access to the Ice Runway, which is on sea ice. The road between the Ice Runway and McMurdo Station varies in length from year to year depending on many factors, including ice stability. These roads are critical for resupplying McMurdo Station, Scott Base, and Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station.\n\nVehicles\n\nThe scarcity and poor quality of road infrastructure limits land transportation by conventional vehicles.\n\nA normal car on tires has very limited capability in Antarctic conditions.  Scientific bases are often built on snow-free areas (oases) close to the\nocean.  Around these stations and on a hard packed snow or ice, tire based vehicles can drive but on deeper and softer snow, a normal tire-based vehicle cannot travel.  Due to these limitations, vehicles on belts have been the preferred option in Antarctica.  In 1997, two specialized cars with very large tires running tire pressure as low as 1.5psi/0.1bar travelled onto the high Antarctica Plateau, giving strong indication that tire based vehicles could be an option for efficient travelling in Antarctica.\n\nMawson Station started using classic Volkswagen Beetles, the first production cars to be used in Antarctica. The first of these was named \"Antarctica 1\".\n\nIn December 1997 into February 1998 two AT44, 4x4 cars (built in Iceland by Arctic Trucks with tire size of 44-inch tall) joined an expedition by the Swedish Polar Institution (SWEA).  The cars got used to transport people and supplies from the Ice shelf to WASA station, to perform scanning of the snow and support a drilling expedition to on the Antarctica Plateau 76\u00b0S 8\u00b003'W.  This is the first time tire based vehicles successfully travel on the Antarctica high plateau.\n\nIn 2005, a team of six people took part in the Ice Challenger Expedition. Travelling in a specially designed six wheel drive vehicle, the team completed the journey from the Antarctic coast at Patriot Hills to the geographic South Pole in 69 hours. In doing so they easily beat the previous record of 24 days. They arrived at the South Pole on December 12, 2005.\n\nThe team members on that expedition were Andrew Regan, Jason De Carteret, Andrew Moon, Richard Griffiths, Gunnar Egilsson and Andrew Miles. The expedition successfully showed that wheeled transport on the continent is not only possible but also often more practical. The expedition also hoped to raise awareness about global warming and climate change.\n\nFrom start of December 2008 into February 2009, four AT44, 4x4 cars were used to support a ski race by Amundsen Omega 3, from S82\u00b0 41' E17\u00b0 43' to South Pole.   A film was made of this race by BBC called \"On Thin Ice\" with Ben Fogle and James Cracknell.   The cars started from Novo airbase at S70\u00b0 49' E11\u00b0 38', establish a route onto the plateau through the crevasse areas in the Shcherbakov Mountain Range driving nearly 1500\u00a0km to the start line of the ski race.  For the return journey each car covered between 5400 and 5800\u00a0km with one fuel depot on the way.\n\nFrom 2008 to date (Dec 2015) tire based cars, AT44 4x4 and AT44 6x6 have been used every season to support various NGO and scientific expedition/projects, supporting flights, fuel drops, filming, skiers, biker, a tractor, collecting snow samples and more.  The combined distance covered on the Antarctica Plateau is over 220 thousand km and even though towing capacity is much lower than for most belt based vehicles, the tire based cars multiply the travel speed and use only a fraction of the fuel making this an option for some expeditions/projects.\n\nA second expedition led by Andrew Regan and Andrew Moon departed in November 2010. The Moon-Regan Trans Antarctic Expedition this time traversed the entire continent twice, using two six-wheel-drive vehicles and a Concept Ice Vehicle designed by Lotus. This time the team used the expedition to raise awareness about the global environmental importance of the Antarctic region and to show that biofuel can be a viable and environmentally friendly option.\n\nWater transport\n\nAntarctica's only harbour is at McMurdo Station. Most coastal stations have offshore anchorages, and supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats, barges, and helicopters. A few stations have a basic wharf facility. All ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with Article 7, Antarctic Treaty. Offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent, but poses no problem to sailboats designed for the ice, typically with lifting keels and long shorelines.\nMcMurdo Station (), Palmer Station (); government use only except by permit (see Permit Office under \"Legal System\"). A number of tour boats, ranging from large motorized vessels to small sailing yachts, visit the Antarctic Peninsula during the summer months (January\u2013March). Most are based in Ushuaia, Argentina.\n\nAir transport\nTransport in Antarctica takes place by air, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.\nRunways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow-free to ensure safe take off and landing conditions.\n\nAntarctica has 20 airports, but there are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities. Thirty stations, operated by 16 national governments party to the Antarctic Treaty, have landing facilities for either helicopters and/or fixed-wing aircraft; commercial enterprises operate two additional air facilities.\n\nHelicopter pads are available at 27 stations; runways at 15 locations are gravel, sea-ice, blue-ice, or compacted snow suitable for landing wheeled, fixed-wing aircraft; of these, one is greater than 3\u00a0km in length, six are between 2\u00a0km and 3\u00a0km in length, 3 are between 1\u00a0km and 2\u00a0km in length, three are less than 1\u00a0km in length, and two are of unknown length; snow surface skiways, limited to use by ski-equipped, fixed-wing aircraft, are available at another 15 locations; of these, four are greater than 3\u00a0km in length, three are between 2\u00a0km and 3\u00a0km in length, two are between 1\u00a0km and 2\u00a0km in length, two are less than 1\u00a0km in length, and data is unavailable for the remaining four.\n\nAntarctic airports are subject to severe restrictions and limitations resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic conditions; they do not meet ICAO standards, and advance approval from the respective governmental or nongovernmental operating organization is required for landing (1999 est.) Flights to the continent in the permanent darkness of the winter are normally only undertaken in an emergency, with burning barrels of fuel to outline a runway. On September 11, 2008, a United States Air Force C-17 Globemaster III successfully completed the first landing in Antarctica using night-vision goggles at Pegasus Field.\n\nIn April 2001 an emergency evacuation of Dr. Ronald Shemenski was needed from Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station when he contracted pancreatitis. Three C-130 Hercules were called back before their final leg because of weather. Organizers then called on Kenn Borek Air based in Calgary, Alberta. Two de Havilland Twin Otters were dispatched out of Calgary with one being back-up. Twin Otters are specifically designed for the Canadian north and Kenn Borek Air's motto is \"Anywhere, Anytime, World-Wide\". The mission was a success but not without difficulties and drawbacks. Ground crews needed to create a 2\u00a0km runway with tracked equipment not designed to operate in the low temperatures at that time of year, the aircraft controls had to be \"jerry-rigged\" when the flaps were frozen in position after landing, and instruments were not reliable because of the cold. When they saw a \"faint pink line on the horizon\" they knew they were going in the right direction.  This was the first rescue from the South Pole during winter. Canada honoured the Otter crew for bravery.\n\nIn 2021, an Airbus A340 aeroplane operated by Portuguese charter airline Hi Fly  landed in Antarctica for the first time.\n\nSee also \nTourism in Antarctica\nList of airports in Antarctica\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nWebpage of the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat on logistics", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "9442", "entropy": "4.566822924907006", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.43861501108413387", "brevity_score": "0.0013458950201884342"}

{"text": "The family Alligatoridae of crocodylians includes alligators and caimans.\n\nPhylogeny\n\nThe superfamily Alligatoroidea includes all crocodilians (fossil and extant) that are more closely related to the American alligator than to either the Nile crocodile or the gharial. This is a stem-based definition for alligators, and is more inclusive than the crown group Alligatoridae.  As a crown group, Alligatoridae only includes the last common ancestor of all extant (living) alligators, caimans, and their descendants (living or extinct), whereas Alligatoroidea, as a stem-based group, also includes more basal extinct alligator ancestors that are more closely related to living alligators than to crocodiles or gavialids. When considering only living taxa (neontology), this makes Alligatoroidea and Alligatoridae redundant.\n\nThe simplified cladogram below shows Alligatoridae's relationships to other extant (living) crocodilians.\n\nThe below detailed cladogram shows one proposal for the internal relationships within Alligatoridae (although the exact alligatoroid phylogeny is still disputed).\n\nEvolution\nThe superfamily Alligatoroidea is thought to have split from the crocodile-gharial lineage in the late Cretaceous, about 87 million years ago. Leidyosuchus of Alberta is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and the Bering Strait have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the early Tertiary or late Cretaceous (about 53 million to about 65 million years ago) and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before the closure of the Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator split from the American alligator about 33 million years ago and likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s. The full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.\n\nTrue alligators \nThe lineage including alligators proper (Alligatorinae) occurs in the fluvial deposits of the age of the Upper Chalk in Europe, where they did not die out until the Pliocene age. The true alligators are today represented by two species, A. mississippiensis in the southeastern United States, which can grow to 15.6\u00a0ft (4.6\u00a0m) and weigh 1000\u00a0lbs(453\u00a0kg), with unverified sizes of up to 19.2\u00a0ft(5.9 m). And the small A. sinensis in the Yangtze River, China, which grows to an average of 5\u00a0ft (1.5\u00a0m). Their name derives from the Spanish el lagarto, which means \"the lizard\".\n\nCaimans \n\nIn Central and South America, the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily Caimaninae, which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony scutes, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Besides the three species in Caiman, the smooth-fronted caimans in genus Paleosuchus and the black caiman in Melanosuchus are described. Caimans tend to be more agile and crocodile-like in their movements, and have longer, sharper teeth than alligators.\n\nC. crocodilus, the spectacled caiman, has the widest distribution, from southern Mexico to the northern half of Argentina, and grows to a modest size of about . The largest is the near-threatened Melanosuchus niger, the jacar\u00e9-a\u00e7u or large or black caiman of the Amazon River basin. Black caimans grow to , with the unverified size of up to . The black caiman and American alligator are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the crocodile family.\n\nAlthough caimans have not been studied in depth, scientists have learned their mating cycles (previously thought to be spontaneous or year-round) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels, which increases chances of survival for their offspring.\n\nTaxonomy \n\n Family Alligatoridae\n Subfamily Alligatorinae\n Genus Alligator\n \u2020 Alligator hailensis\n \u2020 Alligator mcgrewi\n \u2020 Alligator mefferdi\n Alligator mississippiensis, American alligator\n \u2020 Alligator olseni\n \u2020 Alligator prenasalis\n Alligator sinensis, Chinese alligator\n \u2020 Alligator thomsoni\n Genus \u2020 Allognathosuchus\n Genus \u2020 Arambourgia\n Genus \u2020 Ceratosuchus\n Genus \u2020 Chrysochampsa\n Genus \u2020 Eoalligator\n Genus \u2020 Hassiacosuchus\n Genus \u2020 Krabisuchus\n Genus \u2020 Navajosuchus?\n Genus \u2020 Procaimanoidea\n Genus \u2020 Wannaganosuchus\n Subfamily Caimaninae\n Genus \u2020 Acresuchus\n Genus \u2020 Bottosaurus\n Genus Caiman\n \u2020 Caiman brevirostris\n Caiman crocodilus, Spectacled caiman\n Caiman latirostris, Broad-snouted caiman\n \u2020 Caiman lutescans\n \u2020 Caiman venezuelensis\n \u2020 Caiman wannlangstoni\n Caiman yacare, Yacare caiman\n Genus \u2020 Centenariosuchus\n Genus \u2020 Chinatichampsus\n Genus \u2020 Culebrasuchus\n Genus \u2020 Eocaiman\n Genus \u2020 Globidentosuchus\n Genus \u2020 Gnatusuchus\n Genus \u2020 Kuttanacaiman\n Genus Melanosuchus\n \u2020 Melanosuchus fisheri\n Melanosuchus niger, Black caiman\n Genus \u2020 Mourasuchus\n Genus \u2020 Necrosuchus\n Genus \u2020 Orthogenysuchus\n Genus Paleosuchus\n Paleosuchus palpebrosus, Cuvier's dwarf caiman\n Paleosuchus trigonatus, Smooth-fronted caiman\n Genus \u2020 Protocaiman\n Genus \u2020 Purussaurus\n Genus \u2020 Tsoabichi\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\"Crocodilians: Natural History & Conservation\" crocodilian.com\n\"Family Alligatoridae Gray 1844 (alligator)\", fossilworks.org.\n\nCrocodilians\n \nTaxa named by John Edward Gray\nReptile families\nExtant Campanian first appearances\nCampanian taxonomic families\nMaastrichtian taxonomic families\nDanian taxonomic families\nSelandian taxonomic families\nThanetian taxonomic families\nYpresian taxonomic families\nLutetian taxonomic families\nBartonian taxonomic families\nPriabonian taxonomic families\nRupelian taxonomic families\nChattian taxonomic families\nAquitanian taxonomic families\nBurdigalian taxonomic families\nLanghian taxonomic families\nSerravallian taxonomic families\nTortonian taxonomic families\nMessinian taxonomic families\nZanclean taxonomic families\nPiacenzian taxonomic families\nGelasian taxonomic families\nCalabrian taxonomic families\nIonian taxonomic families\nTarantian taxonomic families\nHolocene taxonomic families", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "6410", "entropy": "4.5702491341456675", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.39423817593591126", "brevity_score": "0.002242152466367695"}
{"text": "Andocides (; , Andokides; c. 440 \u2013 c. 390 BC) was a logographer (speech writer) in Ancient Greece.  He was one of the ten Attic orators included in the \"Alexandrian Canon\" compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace in the third century BC.\n\nLife\nAndocides was the son of Leogoras, and was born in Athens around 440 BC. He belonged to the ancient Eupatrid family of the Kerykes, who traced their lineage up to Odysseus and the god Hermes.\n\nDuring his youth, Andocides seems to have been employed on various occasions as ambassador to Thessaly, Macedonia, Molossia, Thesprotia, Italy, and Sicily. And although he was frequently attacked for his political opinions, he maintained his ground until, in 415, he became involved in the charge brought against Alcibiades for having profaned the mysteries and mutilated the Herms on the eve of the departure of the Athenian expedition against Sicily. It appeared particularly likely that Andocides was an accomplice in the latter of these crimes, which was believed to be a preliminary step towards overthrowing the democratic constitution, since the Herm standing close to his house in the phyle Aegeis was among the very few which had not been injured.\n\nAndocides was accordingly seized and thrown into prison, but after some time recovered his freedom by a promise that he would become an informer and reveal the names of the real perpetrators of the crime; and on the suggestion of one Charmides or Timaeus, he mentioned four, all of whom were put to death. He is also said to have denounced his own father on the charge of profaning the mysteries, but to have rescued him again in the hour of danger - a charge he strenuously denied. But as Andocides was unable to clear himself from the charge, he was deprived of his rights as a citizen, and left Athens.\n\nAndocides traveled about in various parts of Greece, and was chiefly engaged in commercial enterprise and in forming connections with powerful people. The means he employed to gain the friendship of powerful men were sometimes of the most disreputable kind; among which a service he rendered to a prince in Cyprus is mentioned in particular.\n\nIn 411, Andocides returned to Athens on the establishment of the oligarchic government of the Four Hundred, hoping that a certain service he had rendered the Athenian ships at Samos would secure him a welcome reception. But no sooner were the oligarchs informed of the return of Andocides, than their leader Peisander had him seized, and accused him of having supported the party opposed to them at Samos. During his trial, Andocides, who perceived the exasperation prevailing against him, leaped to the altar which stood in the court, and there assumed the attitude of a supplicant. This saved his life, but he was imprisoned. Soon afterwards, however, he was set free, or escaped from prison.\n\nAndocides then went to Cyprus, where for a time he enjoyed the friendship of Evagoras; but, by some circumstance or other, he exasperated his friend, and was consigned to prison. Here again he escaped, and after the restoration of democracy in Athens and the abolition of the Four Hundred, he ventured once more to return to Athens; but as he was still suffering under a sentence of civil disenfranchisement, he endeavored by means of bribes to persuade the prytaneis to allow him to attend the assembly of the people. The latter, however, expelled him from the city. It was on this occasion, in 411, that Andocides delivered the speech still extant \"On his return\", on which he petitioned for permission to reside at Athens, but in vain. In his third exile, Andocides went to reside in Elis, and during the time of his absence from his native city, his house there was occupied by Cleophon, the leading demagogue.\n\nAndocides remained in exile until after the overthrow of the tyranny of the Thirty by Thrasybulus, when the general amnesty then proclaimed made him hope that its benefit would be extended to him also. He himself says that he returned to Athens from Cyprus, where he claimed to have great influence and considerable property. Because of the general amnesty, he was allowed to remain at Athens, enjoyed peace for the next three years, and soon recovered an influential position. According to Lysias, it was scarcely ten days after his return that he brought an accusation against Archippus or Aristippus, which, however, he dropped on receiving a sum of money. During this period Andocides became a member of the boule, in which he appears to have possessed a great influence, as well as in the popular assembly. He was gymnasiarch at the Hephaestaea, was sent as architheorus to the Isthmian Games and Olympic Games, and was even entrusted with the office of keeper of the sacred treasury.\n\nBut in 400, Callias, supported by Cephisius, Agyrrhius, Meletus, and Epichares, urged the necessity of preventing Andocides from attending the assembly, as he had never been formally freed from the civil disenfranchisement. Callias also charged him with violating the laws respecting the temple at Eleusis. The orator pleaded his case in the oration still extant \"on the Mysteries\" (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd), in which he argued that he had not been involved in the profanation of the mysteries or the mutilation of the herms, that he had not violated the laws of the temple at Eleusis, that anyway he had received his citizenship back as a result of the amnesty, and that Callias was really motivated by a private dispute with Andocides over inheritance. He was acquitted. After this, he again enjoyed peace until 394, when he was sent as ambassador to Sparta regarding the peace to be concluded in consequence of Conon's victory off Cnidus. On his return he was accused of illegal conduct during his embassy. The speech \"On the peace with the Lacedaemonians\" (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2), which is still extant, refers to this affair. It was delivered in 393 (though some scholars place it in 391). Andocides was found guilty, and sent into exile for the fourth time. He never returned afterwards, and seems to have died soon after this blow.\n\nAndocides appears to have fathered no children, since he is described at the age of 70 as being childless, although the scholiast on Aristophanes mentions Antiphon as a son of Andocides. The large fortune which he had inherited from his father, or acquired in his commercial undertakings, was greatly diminished in the latter years of his life.\n\nOratory\nAs an orator Andocides does not appear to have been held in very high esteem by the ancients, as he is seldom mentioned, though Valerius Theon is said to have written a commentary on his orations. We do not hear of his having been trained in any of the sophistical schools of the time, and he had probably developed his talents in the practical school of the popular assembly. Hence his orations have no mannerism in them, and are really, as Plutarch says, simple and free from all rhetorical pomp and ornament.\n\nSometimes, however, his style is diffuse, and becomes tedious and obscure. The best among his orations is that \"on the Mysteries\"; but, for the history of the time, all are of the highest importance.\n\nBesides the three orations already mentioned, which are undoubtedly genuine, there is a fourth against Alcibiades (\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f08\u03bb\u03ba\u03b9\u03b2\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5), said to have been delivered by Andocides during the ostracism of 415; but it is probably spurious, though it appears to contain genuine historical matter. Some scholars ascribed it to Phaeax, who took part in the ostracism, according to Plutarch. But it is more likely that it is a rhetorical exercise from the early fourth century BC, since formal speeches were not delivered during ostracisms and the accusation or defence of Alcibiades was a standing rhetorical theme. Besides these four orations we possess only a few fragments and some very vague allusions to other orations.\n\nList of extant speeches\nOn the Mysteries ( \"De Mysteriis\"). Andocides' defense against the charge of impiety in the profanation of the Eleusinian Mysteries and the mutilation of the Hermae.\nOn His Return ( \"De Reditu\"). Andocides' plea for his return and removal of civil disabilities.\nOn the Peace with Sparta ( \"De Pace\"). An argument for peace with Sparta.\nAgainst Alcibiades ( \"Contra Alcibiadem\").

{"text": "Arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant, to inform them of the charges against them. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a plea. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include \"guilty\", \"not guilty\", and the peremptory pleas (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. Pleas of \"nolo contendere\" (no contest) and the \"Alford plea\" are allowed in some circumstances.\n\nAustralia \n\nIn Australia, arraignment is the first of 11 stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment. The judge will testify during the indictment process.\n\nCanada \n\nIn every province in Canada, except British Columbia, defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial.  In British Columbia, arraignment takes place in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer. The defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge.\n\nFrance \n\nIn France, the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest. However, police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances, especially if the offence is punishable by at least one year's imprisonment, or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time, and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking or organised crime. The police need to have the consent of the prosecutor, the procureur.  In the vast majority of cases, the prosecutor will consent.\n\nGermany \n\nIn Germany, if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest.\n\nNew Zealand \n\nIn New Zealand law, at the first appearance of the accused, they are read the charges and asked for a plea. The available pleas are: guilty, not guilty, and no plea.  No plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea, which must be made on the second appearance.\n\nSouth Africa \n\nIn South Africa, arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear, the informing of the accused of the crime charged against them, the demanding of the accused whether they plead guilty or not guilty, and the entering of their plea. Their plea having been entered, they are said to stand arraigned.\n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nIn England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, arraignment is the first of 11 stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment.\n\nIn England and Wales, the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than 24 hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent (or above) authorises detention for a further 12 hours (36 hours total), or a judge (who will be a magistrate) authorises detention by the police before charge for up to a maximum of 96 hours, but for terrorism-related offences people can be held by the police for up to 28 days before charge. If they are not released after being charged, they should be brought before a court as soon as practicable.\n\nUnited States \n\nUnder the United States Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \"arraignment shall [...] [consist of an] open [...] reading [of] the indictment [...] to the defendant [...] and call[] on [them] to plead thereto. [They] shall be given a copy of the indictment [...] before [they are] called upon to plead.\"\n\nIn federal courts, arraignment takes place in two stages. The first is called the \"initial arraignment\" and must take place within 48 hours of an individual's arrest, 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until Monday. During this stage, the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel. The presiding judge also decides at what amount, if any, to set bail. During the second stage, a post-indictment arraignment (PIA), the defendant is allowed to enter a plea.\n\nIn New York, most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours.\n\nIn California, arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and, in any event, within 48 hours of arrest, excluding weekends and holidays.\n\nForm of the arraignment\nThe wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  However, it generally conforms with the following principles:\n The accused person (defendant) is addressed by name;\n The charge against the accused person is read, including the alleged date, time, and place of offense (and sometimes the names of the state's witnesses and the range of punishment for the charge(s)); and,\n The accused person is asked formally how he or she pleads.\n\nVideo arraignment\nVideo arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of videoconferencing technology. Use of video arraignment system allows the court to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the courtroom by using an audio-visual link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.\n\nUse of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. The transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.\n\nGuilty and not-guilty pleas\nIf the defendant pleads guilty, an evidentiary hearing usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the mitigating factors, and the defendant's character, and passes sentence.\n\nIf the defendant pleads not guilty, a date is set for a preliminary hearing or a trial.\n\nIn the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or \"stood mute\") was subject to peine forte et dure (Law French for \"strong and hard punishment\"). Today, in common law jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea. The rationale for this is the defendant's right to silence.\n\nPre-trial release\nThis is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre-trial release and bail may be made, depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction.\n\nSee also\nDesk appearance ticket\n\nReferences\n\nLegal terminology\nProsecution\nUnited States criminal procedure\nCriminal law of the United Kingdom\nAustralian criminal law", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "6586", "entropy": "4.406826290944826", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.40297600971758274", "brevity_score": "0.0021231422505307955"}
{"text": "Amaryllis () is the only genus in the subtribe Amaryllidinae (tribe Amaryllideae). It is a small genus of flowering bulbs, with two species. The better known of the two, Amaryllis belladonna, is a native of the Western Cape region of South Africa, particularly the rocky southwest area between the Olifants River Valley and Knysna. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names Amaryllis and Hippeastrum, one result of which is that the common name \"amaryllis\" is mainly used for cultivars of the genus Hippeastrum, widely sold in the winter months for their ability to bloom indoors. Plants of the genus Amaryllis are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern Australia or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name \"lily\" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, Lilium. In the Victorian Language of Flowers (see Plant symbolism), amaryllis means \"pride, determination and radiant beauty\".\n\nDescription \n\nAmaryllis is a bulbous plant, with each bulb being  in diameter. It has several strap-shaped, hysteranthous, green leaves with midrib,  long and  broad, arranged in two rows.\n\nEach bulb produces one or two leafless, stout, persistent and erect stems 30\u201360\u00a0cm tall, each of which bears at the top a cluster of two to twelve zygomorphic, funnel-shaped flowers without a tube. Each flower is  diameter with six spreading tepals (three outer sepals, three inner petals, with similar appearance to each other). The usual color is white with crimson veins, but pink or purple also occur naturally. Stamens are very shortly connate basally, declinate, unequal. Style is declinate, stigma is three-lobed. Ovules are approx. 8 per locule. Seeds are compressed-globose, white to pink. Number of chromosomes is 2n = 22.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe single genus is in subtribe Amaryllidinae, in the tribe Amaryllideae. The taxonomy of the genus has been controversial. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the name Amaryllis belladonna, the type species of the genus Amaryllis. At the time both South African and South American plants were placed in the same genus; subsequently they were separated into two different genera. The key question is whether Linnaeus's type was a South African plant or a South American plant. If the latter, Amaryllis would be the correct name for the genus Hippeastrum, and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here. Alan W. Meerow et al. have briefly summarized the debate, which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the Atlantic. The outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that Amaryllis L. should be a conserved name (i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African Amaryllis belladonna from the Clifford Herbarium at the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nSpecies\n, Amaryllis had only two accepted species, both native to the Cape Provinces of South Africa:\nAmaryllis belladonna L. \u2013 south-west Cape Provinces; introduced into many parts of the world, including California, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand\nAmaryllis paradisicola Snijman \u2013 west Cape Provinces\n\nPhylogeny \nAmaryllidinae are placed within Amaryllideae as follow:\n\nThese are phylogenetically related as follows:\n\nEtymology \nThe name Amaryllis is taken from a shepherdess in Virgil's pastoral Eclogues, (from the Greek  (), meaning \"to sparkle\") and also from \"amarella\" for the bitterness of the bulb.\n\nAlthough the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus, the common name \"amaryllis\" continues to be used differently. Bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as \"ready to bloom for the holidays\" belong to the allied genus Hippeastrum. The common name \"naked lady\" comes from the plant's pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down. This name is also used for other bulbs with a similar growth and flowering pattern; some of these have their own widely used and accepted common names, such as the resurrection lily (Lycoris squamigera).\n\nHabitat \nIn areas of its native habitat with mountainous fynbos flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth. In more open sandy areas of the Western Cape, the plant flowers annually. Plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds' large size and heavy weight. Strong winds shake loose the seeds, which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate, aided by the first winter rains.\n\nEcology \nThe leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. The plant is not frost-tolerant, nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production.\n\nOne or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer (March in its native habitat and August in USDA zone 7).\n\nThe plant has a symbiotic relationship with carpenter bees. It is also visited by noctuid moths at night. The relative importance of these animals as pollinators has not yet been established; however, carpenter bees are thought to be the main pollinators of amaryllis on the Cape Peninsula. The plant's main parasite is the lily borer Brithys crini and/or Diaphone eumela.\n\nCultivation\n\nAmaryllis belladonna was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century. It reproduces slowly by either bulb division or seeds and has gradually naturalized from plantings in urban and suburban areas throughout the lower elevations and coastal areas in much of the West Coast of the US since these environments mimic their native South African habitat. Hardiness zones 6\u20138. It is also naturalized in Australia.\n\nThere is an Amaryllis belladonna hybrid which was bred in the 1800s in Australia. No one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white, cream, peach, magenta and nearly red hues. The hybrids were crossed back onto the original Amaryllis belladonna and with each other to produce naturally seed-bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes, shapes, stem heights and intensities of pink. Pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well. The hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes, veining, darkened edges, white centers and light yellow centers, also setting them apart from the original light pink. In addition, the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the \"side-facing\" habit of the \"old-fashioned\" pink. The hybrids are able to adapt to year-round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be.\n\nA.\u00a0belladonna has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.\n\nAmaryllis belladonna has been crossed in cultivation with Crinum moorei to produce a hybrid called \u00d7\u00a0Amarcrinum, which has named cultivars. Hybrids said to be between Amaryllis belladonna and Brunsvigia josephinae have been called \u00d7\u00a0Amarygia. Neither hybrid genus name is accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families.\n\nSee also\n\n List of plants known as lily\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAmaryllidoideae\nAmaryllidaceae genera\nChristmas plants\nGarden plants of Africa\nTaxa named by Carl Linnaeus", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "7590", "entropy": "4.491443460100423", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.45568122041031034", "brevity_score": "0.0016286644951140207"}
{"text": "In Greek mythology, Aeolus (;  , ) is a name shared by three mythical characters. These three personages are often difficult to tell apart, and even the ancient mythographers appear to have been perplexed about which Aeolus was which. Diodorus Siculus made an attempt to define each of these three (although it is clear that he also became muddled), and his opinion is followed here. \n The first Aeolus was a son of Hellen and eponymous founder of the Aeolian race.\n The second Aeolus was a son of Poseidon, who led a colony to islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n The third Aeolus was a son of Hippotes who is mentioned in Odyssey and the Aeneid as the Keeper of the Winds.\n\nAll three men named Aeolus appear to be connected genealogically, although the precise relationship, especially regarding the second and third Aeolus, is often ambiguous as their identities seem to have been merged by many ancient writers.\n\nAeolus was also the name of the following minor characters:\n Aeolus, a defender of Thebes in the war of the Seven against Thebes. He was killed by Parthenopaeus.\n Aeolus, a Trojan companion of Aeneas in Italy, where he was killed by Turnus, King of the Rutulians. Aeolus was father of Clytius and Misenus. \"Otherwise unknown to fame\", he survived both the Greeks and Achilles at Troy, and Richard F.

{"text": "Aelianus Tacticus (; fl. 2nd century AD), also known as Aelian (), was a Greek military writer who lived in Rome.\n\nWork\nAelian's military treatise in fifty-three chapters on the tactics of the Greeks, titled On Tactical Arrays of the Greeks (), is dedicated to the emperor Hadrian, though this is probably a mistake for Trajan, and the date 106 has been assigned to it. It is a handbook of Greek, i.e. Macedonian, drill and tactics as practiced by the Hellenistic successors of Alexander the Great. The author claims to have consulted all the best authorities, the most important of which was a lost treatise on the subject by Polybius. Perhaps the chief value of Aelian's work lies in his critical account of preceding works on the art of war, and in the fullness of his technical details in matters of drill.\n\nAelian also gives a brief account of the constitution of a Roman army at that time. The work arose, he says, from a conversation he had with the emperor Nerva at Frontinus's house at Formiae. He promises a work on Naval Tactics also; but this, if it was written, is lost.\n\nCritics of the 18th century \u2014 Guichard Folard and the Prince de Ligne \u2014 were unanimous in thinking Aelian greatly inferior to Arrian, but Aelian exercised a great influence both on his immediate successors, the Byzantines, and later on the Arabs, (who translated the text for their own use). The author of the Strategikon ascribed to the emperor Maurice selectively used Aelian's work as a conceptional model, especially its preface. Emperor Leo VI the Wise incorporated much of Aelian's text in his own Taktika. The Arabic version of Aelian was made about 1350. It was first translated into Latin by Theodore Gaza, published at Rome in 1487. The Greek editio princeps was edited by Francesco Robortello and published at Venice in 1552.\n\nIn spite of its academic nature, the copious details to be found in the treatise rendered it of the highest value to the army organisers of the 16th century, who were engaged in fashioning a regular military system out of the semi-feudal systems of previous generations. The Macedonian phalanx of Aelian had many points of resemblance to the solid masses of pikemen and the squadrons of cavalry of the Spanish and Dutch systems, and the translations made in the 16th century formed the groundwork of numerous books on drill and tactics.\n\nThe first significant reference to the influence of Aelian in the 16th century is a letter to Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange from his cousin William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg on December 8, 1594. The letter is influential in supporting the thesis of the early-modern Military Revolution. In the letter, William Louis discusses the use of ranks by soldiers of Imperial Rome as discussed in Aelian's Tactica. Aelian was discussing the use of the counter march in the context of the Roman sword gladius and spear pilum. William Louis in a 'crucial leap' realised that the same technique could work for men with firearms.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nAncient Greek writers\nRoman-era Greeks\n2nd-century writers\nAncient Macedonian army\nAncient Greek military writers\n2nd-century Greek people", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "3152", "entropy": "4.4898893629405725", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.49429657794676807", "brevity_score": "0.00352112676056338"}

The state was founded in 1785, and its capital was in Ajaigarh.\n\nHistory\n\nAjaigarh was the capital of a princely state of the same name during the British Raj. Ajaigarh was founded in 1765 by Guman Singh, a Bundela Rajput who was the nephew of Raja Pahar Singh of Jaitpur. After Ajaigarh was captured by the British in 1809, it became a princely state in the Bundelkhand Agency of the Central India Agency. It had an area of , and a population of 78,236 in 1901. The rulers bore the title of sawai maharaja. He commanded an estimated annual revenue of about \u00a315,000/-, and paid a tribute of \u00a3460/-.  The chief resided at the town of Nowgong, at the foot of the hill-fortress of Ajaigarh, from which the state took its name. This fort, situated on a steep hill, towers more than  above the eponymous township, and contains the ruins of several temples adorned with elaborately carved sculptures. The town was often afflicted by malaria, and suffered severely from famine in 1868\u201369 and 1896\u201397.\n\nThe state acceded to the Government of India on 1 January 1950; the ruling chief was granted a privy purse of Rs. 74,700/-, and the courtesy use of his styles and titles. All of these were revoked by the government of India in 1971, at the time when these privileges were revoked from all erstwhile princes. The former princely state became part of the new Indian state of Vindhya Pradesh, and most of the territory of the former state, including the town of Ajaigarh, became part of Panna District, with a smaller portion going to Chhatarpur District. Vindhya Pradesh was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956.\n\nRulers of Ajaygarh\n\n                   Maharajadhiraja Chhatrasal    : 1649\u20131731\n                (founder ruler of many kingdoms)\n     ___|__\n Hirdeshah                   Jagatraj                   Bhartichandra\n  (Panna)                    (Jaitpur)                     (Jaso)\n    |__\n Vir Singh                   Kirat Singh                  Pahar Singh (1758\u20131765)\n    |__\n Khuman Singh           Guman Singh (1765\u20131792)             Durg Singh\n (Charkari)               (Banda)(No issues)                   |\n                                |__Son of__|\n                            Bhakhat Singh         :b. 1792-d. 1837\n                      (Founder ruler of Ajaigarh)\n   _|___\n                         Madho Singh (r. 1837\u20131849)   Mahipat Singh (r. 1849\u20131853)\n                           (No male issue)                     |\n                                                               |\n                         Ranjore Singh (K.C.I.E)__Vijay Singh (R. 1853\u20131855)\n                           (born 1844; died 1919)         (died early, fell from horse)                                                                                             \n   _|                                                                                                                                                      \n Jaipal Singh           Bhopal Singh (K.C.I.E.)

It stands alone on a hilltop in the district of Panna and is easily accessible from Khajuraho. The fort is bordered by the beautiful Vindhya Hills and provides stunning views of the Ken River. This grand fort is noted for its rich historical past and architectural beauty, which speaks volumes about the Chandela dynasty.\n\nThere is plenty to explore at the fort, which makes it a treat for history and art lovers. Reminiscent of old times, this fort has two gates (earlier there were five), two temples and two rock-cut tanks, close to the northern gate. These tanks have been named as Ganga and Yamuna.\n\nGallery\n\nDemographics\nAs of the 2001 India census, Ajaigarh had a population of 13,979. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Ajaigarh has an average literacy rate of 59%, which is lower than the national average of 59.5%; with 61% of the males and 39% of females literate. 16% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAjaigarh photo callery\nAjaigarh Fort & Valley\n\nPopulated places established in 1765\nBundelkhand\nCities and towns in Panna district\nTourist attractions in Panna district", "type": "wikipedia", "length": "5254", "entropy": "4.111234151353334", "gzip_compression_ratio": "0.3896054628224583", "brevity_score": "0.0027777777777777866"}
{"text": "The Apache Software Foundation  (ASF) is an American nonprofit corporation (classified as a 501(c)(3) organization in the United States) to support a number of open source software projects. The ASF was formed from a group of developers of the Apache HTTP Server, and incorporated on March 25, 1999. As of 2021, it includes approximately 1000 members.\n\nThe Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License and is a non-copyleft form of free and open-source software (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license, which is to say that it allows developers who receive the software freely, to re-distribute it under nonfree terms.  Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a meritocracy, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation open-source organization, in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock-in.\n\nAmong the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects; to prevent the Apache brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.\n\nThe ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related technology.\n\nHistory\nThe history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server, development beginning in February 1993. A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the NCSA HTTPd daemon. They came to be known as the Apache Group. On March 25, 1999, the Apache Software Foundation was formed. The first official meeting of the Apache Software Foundation was held on April 13, 1999. The initial members of the Apache Software Foundation consisted of the Apache Group: Brian Behlendorf, Ken Coar, Miguel Gonzales, Mark Cox, Lars Eilebrecht, Ralf S. Engelschall, Roy T. Fielding, Dean Gaudet, Ben Hyde, Jim Jagielski, Alexei Kosut, Martin Kraemer, Ben Laurie, Doug MacEachern, Aram Mirzadeh, Sameer Parekh, Cliff Skolnick, Marc Slemko, William (Bill) Stoddard, Paul Sutton, Randy Terbush and Dirk-Willem van Gulik. After a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation, the effective incorporation date of the Apache Software Foundation was set to June 1, 1999.\n\nThe foundation states that the name 'Apache' was chosen \"from respect for the Native American Apache Nation, well known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance\".\n\nProjects\n\nApache divides its software development activities into separate semi-autonomous areas called \"top-level projects\" (formally known as a \"Project Management Committee\" in the bylaws), some of which have a number of sub-projects. Unlike some other organizations that host FOSS projects, before a project is hosted at Apache it has to be licensed to the ASF with a grant or contributor agreement. In this way, the ASF gains the necessary intellectual property rights for the development and distribution of all its projects.\n\nBoard of directors\nThe Board of Directors of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is responsible for management and oversight of the business and affairs of the corporation in accordance with the Bylaws. This includes management of the corporate assets (funds, intellectual property, trademarks, and support equipment), appointment of a President and corporate officers managing the core operations of the ASF, and allocation of corporate resources for the benefit of Apache projects. Technical decision-making authority for every Apache project is assigned to their independent project management committee; the participants in each project provide direction, not the board.\nThe board is elected annually by the ASF membership.\n\nSince March 17, 2021, the board of directors has been:\n\n Bertrand Delacretaz\n Roy T.

We will make an effort to support the library, but we reserve the right to make incompatible changes when necessary.\n\n## Install\n\nBe sure `https://rubygems.org/` is in your gem sources.\n\nFor normal client usage, this is sufficient:\n\n```bash\n$ gem install google-api-client\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'google/api_client'\nrequire 'google/api_client/client_secrets'\nrequire 'google/api_client/auth/installed_app'\n\n# Initialize the client.\nclient = Google::APIClient.new(\n  :application_name => 'Example Ruby application',\n  :application_version => '1.0.0'\n)\n\n# Initialize Google+ API. Note this will make a request to the\n# discovery service every time, so be sure to use serialization\n# in your production code. Check the samples for more details.\nplus = client.discovered_api('plus')\n\n# Load client secrets from your client_secrets.json.\nclient_secrets = Google::APIClient::ClientSecrets.load\n\n# Run installed application flow. Check the samples for a more\n# complete example that saves the credentials between runs.\nflow = Google::APIClient::InstalledAppFlow.new(\n  :client_id => client_secrets.client_id,\n  :client_secret => client_secrets.client_secret,\n  :scope => ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.me']\n)\nclient.authorization = flow.authorize\n\n# Make an API call.\nresult = client.execute(\n  :api_method => plus.activities.list,\n  :parameters => {'collection' => 'public', 'userId' => 'me'}\n)\n\nputs result.data\n```\n\n## API Features\n\n### API Discovery\n\nTo take full advantage of the client, load API definitions prior to use. To load an API:\n\n```ruby\nurlshortener = client.discovered_api('urlshortener')\n```\n\nSpecific versions of the API can be loaded as well:\n\n```ruby\ndrive = client.discovered_api('drive', 'v2')\n```\n\nLocally cached discovery documents may be used as well. To load an API from a local file:\n\n```ruby\n# Output discovery document to JSON\nFile.open('my-api.json', 'w') do |f| f.puts MultiJson.dump(client.discovery_document('myapi', 'v1')) end\n\n# Read discovery document and load API\ndoc = File.read('my-api.json')\nclient.register_discovery_document('myapi', 'v1', doc)\nmy_api = client.discovered_api('myapi', 'v1')\n```\n\n### Authorization\n\nMost interactions with Google APIs require users to authorize applications via OAuth 2.0. The client library uses [Signet](https://github.com/google/signet) to handle most aspects of authorization. For additional details about Google's OAuth support, see [Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2).\n\nCredentials can be managed at the connection level, as shown, or supplied on a per-request basis when calling `execute`.\n\nFor server-to-server interactions, like those between a web application and Google Cloud Storage, Prediction, or BigQuery APIs, use service accounts.\n\nAs of version 0.8.3, service accounts can be configured using\n[Application Default Credentials][1], which rely on the credentials being\navailable in a well-known location.  If the credentials are not present\nand it's being used on a Compute Engine VM,  it will use the VM's default credentials.\n\n```ruby\nclient.authorization = :google_app_default  # in a later version, this will become the default\nclient.authorization.fetch_access_token!\nclient.execute(...)\n```\n\nThis is simpler API to use than in previous versions, although that is still available:\n\n```ruby\nkey = Google::APIClient::KeyUtils.load_from_pkcs12('client.p12', 'notasecret')\nclient.authorization = Signet::OAuth2::Client.new(\n  :token_credential_uri => 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token',\n  :audience => 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token',\n  :scope => 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/prediction',\n  :issuer => '123456-abcdef@developer.gserviceaccount.com',\n  :signing_key => key)\nclient.authorization.fetch_access_token!\nclient.execute(...)\n```\n\nService accounts are also used for delegation in Google Apps domains. The target user for impersonation is specified by setting the `:person` parameter to the user's email address\nin the credentials. Detailed instructions on how to enable delegation for your domain can be found at [developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/drive/delegation).\n\n### Automatic Retries & Backoff\n\nThe API client can automatically retry requests for recoverable errors. To enable retries, set the `client.retries` property to\nthe number of additional attempts. To avoid flooding servers, retries invovle a 1 second delay that increases on each subsequent retry.\nIn the case of authentication token expiry, the API client will attempt to refresh the token and retry the failed operation - this\nis a specific exception to the retry rules.\n\nThe default value for retries is 0, but will be enabled by default in future releases.\n\n### Batching Requests\n\nSome Google APIs support batching requests into a single HTTP request. Use `Google::APIClient::BatchRequest`\nto bundle multiple requests together.\n\nExample:\n\n```ruby\nclient = Google::APIClient.new\nurlshortener = client.discovered_api('urlshortener')\n\nbatch = Google::APIClient::BatchRequest.new do |result|\n    puts result.data\nend\n\nbatch.add(:api_method => urlshortener.url.insert,\n          :body_object => { 'longUrl' => 'http://example.com/foo' })\nbatch.add(:api_method => urlshortener.url.insert,\n          :body_object => { 'longUrl' => 'http://example.com/bar' })\nclient.execute(batch)\n```\n\nBlocks for handling responses can be specified either at the batch level or when adding an individual API call. For example:\n\n```ruby\nbatch.add(:api_method=>urlshortener.url.insert, :body_object => { 'longUrl' => 'http://example.com/bar' }) do |result|\n   puts result.data\nend\n```\n\n### Media Upload\n\nFor APIs that support file uploads, use `Google::APIClient::UploadIO` to load the stream. Both multipart and resumable\nuploads can be used. For example, to upload a file to Google Drive using multipart\n\n```ruby\ndrive = client.discovered_api('drive', 'v2')\n\nmedia = Google::APIClient::UploadIO.new('mymovie.m4v', 'video/mp4')\nmetadata = {\n    'title' => 'My movie',\n    'description' => 'The best home movie ever made'\n}\nclient.execute(:api_method => drive.files.insert,\n               :parameters => { 'uploadType' => 'multipart' },\n               :body_object => metadata,\n               :media => media )\n```\n\nTo use resumable uploads, change the `uploadType` parameter to `resumable`. To check the status of the upload\nand continue if necessary, check `result.resumable_upload`.\n\n```ruby\nclient.execute(:api_method => drive.files.insert,\n           :parameters => { 'uploadType' => 'resumable' },\n           :body_object => metadata,\n           :media => media )\nupload = result.resumable_upload\n\n# Resume if needed\nif upload.resumable?\n    client.execute(upload)\nend\n```\n\n## Samples\n\nSee the full list of [samples on Github](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client-samples).\n\n\n## Support\n\nPlease [report bugs at the project on Github](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client/issues).

{"text": "# Decision making in the curl project\n\nA rough guide to how we make decisions and who does what.\n\n## BDFL\n\nThis project was started by and has to some extent been pushed forward over\nthe years with Daniel Stenberg as the driving force. It matches a standard\nBDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) style project.\n\nThis setup has been used due to convenience and the fact that is has worked\nfine this far. It is not because someone thinks of it as a superior project\nleadership model. It will also only continue working as long as Daniel manages\nto listen in to what the project and the general user population wants and\nexpects from us.\n\n## Legal entity\n\nThere is no legal entity. The curl project is just a bunch of people scattered\naround the globe with the common goal to produce source code that creates\ngreat products.\n\nThe copyrights in the project are owned by the individuals and organizations\nthat wrote those parts of the code.\n\n## Decisions\n\nThe curl project is not a democracy, but everyone is entitled to state their\nopinion and may argue for their sake within the community.\n\nAll and any changes that have been done or will be done are eligible to bring\nup for discussion, to object to or to praise. Ideally, we find consensus for\nthe appropriate way forward in any given situation or challenge.\n\nIf there is no obvious consensus, a maintainer who's knowledgeable in the\nspecific area will take an \"executive\" decision that they think is the right\nfor the project.\n\n## Key roles\n\n### Maintainers\n\nA maintainer in the curl project is an individual who has been given\npermissions to push commits to one of the git repositories.\n\nMaintainers are free to push commits to the repositories at their own will.\nMaintainers are however expected to listen to feedback from users and any\nchange that is non-trivial in size or nature *should* be brought to the\nproject as a PR to allow others to comment/object before merge.\n\n### Former maintainers\n\nA maintainer who stops being active in the project will at some point get\ntheir push permissions removed. We do this for security reasons but also to\nmake sure that we always have the list of maintainers as \"the team that push\nstuff to curl\".\n\nGetting push permissions removed is not a punishment. Everyone who ever worked\non maintaining curl is considered a hero, for all time hereafter.\n\n### Security team members\n\nWe have a security team. That's the team of people who are subscribed to the\ncurl-security mailing list; the receivers of security reports from users and\ndevelopers. This list of people will vary over time but should be skilled\ndevelopers familiar with the curl project.\n\nThe security team works best when it consists of a small set of active\npersons. We invite new members when the team seems to need it, and we also\nexpect to retire security team members as they \"drift off\" from the project or\njust find themselves unable to perform their duties there.\n\n### Server admins\n\nWe run a web server, a mailing list and more on the curl project's primary\nserver. That physical machine is owned and run by Haxx. Daniel is the primary\nadmin of all things curl related server stuff, but Bj\u00f6rn Stenberg and Linus\nFeltzing serve as backup admins for when Daniel is gone or unable.\n\nThe primary server is paid for by Haxx. The machine is physically located in a\nserver bunker in Stockholm Sweden, operated by the company Portlane.\n\nThe web site contents are served to the web via Fastly and Daniel is the\nprimary curl contact with Fastly.\n\n### BDFL\n\nThat's Daniel.\n\n# Maintainers\n\nA curl maintainer is a project volunteer who has the authority and rights to\nmerge changes into a git repository in the curl project.\n\nAnyone can aspire to become a curl maintainer.\n\n### Duties\n\nThere are no mandatory duties. We hope and wish that maintainers consider\nreviewing patches and help merching them, especially when the changes are\nwithin the area of personal expertise and experience.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- only merge code that meets our quality and style guide requirements.\n- *never* merge code without doing a PR first, unless the change is \"trivial\"\n- if in doubt, ask for input/feedback from others\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- please enable 2fa on your github account to reduce risk of malicious sourc\n  code tampering\n- consider enabling signed git commits for additional verification of changes\n\n### Merge advice\n\nWhen you're merging patches/PRs...\n\n- make sure the commit messages follow our template\n- squash patch sets into a few logical commits even if the PR didn't, if\n  necessary\n- avoid the \"merge\" button on github, do it \"manually\" instead to get full\n  control and full audit trail (github leaves out you as \"Committer:\")\n- remember to credit the reporter and the helpers!\n\n## Who are maintainers?\n\nThe [list of maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/curl/people). Be aware that\nthe level of presence and activity in the project vary greatly between\ndifferent individuals and over time.\n\n### Become a maintainer?\n\nIf you think you can help making the project better by shouldering some\nmaintaining responsibilities, then please get in touch.\n\nYou will be expected to be familiar with the curl project and its ways of\nworking. You need to have gotten a few quality patches merged as a proof of\nthis.\n\n### Stop being a maintainer\n\nIf you (appear to) not be active in the project anymore, you may be removed as\na maintainer.

We performed additional post hoc analyses of pooled data from these studies to compare further the efficacy of the two treatments. The studies used identical 3-month, parallel group, randomized, observer-masked and patient-masked, multicenter designs. Patients with a baseline IOP > or = 24 mm Hg were randomized to either the 2% dorzolamide/0.5% timolol combination eye drops twice daily (n = 273) or 0.005% latanoprost eye drops once daily (n = 271). The IOP measurements were made at 8 AM, 10 AM, 2 PM, and 4 PM at the baseline visit and then on each of the 3 monthly assessment days. The following measures were analyzed on a post hoc basis: 1) percentages of patients meeting target levels of IOP reduction; 2) mean IOP reduction in those patients with high IOP (> or =30 mmHg) at baseline; 3) mean IOP at each of the assessment time points during a day. A total of 259 patients in the dorzolamide/timolol group and 268 patients in the latanoprost group were included in the efficacy analysis. At 3 months, both treatments showed similar efficacy with regard to the percentages of patients who achieved target levels of IOP reduction (e.g., 40% IOP reduction in 15% of dorzolamide/timolol combination patients and 13% of latanoprost patients), mean IOP reduction in those patients with high IOP at baseline (dorzolamide/ timolol combination, 12.5 mmHg, latanoprost, 12.6 mmHg), and mean IOP at each time point during the day.

At individual time points, there was a significant difference between groups at 0800, 0100, 1200, 1800, and 2000 hours with BTFC having greater ocular hypotensive effect, P<0.001. The most frequently reported adverse event in the study was conjunctival hyperaemia. Average hyperaemia scores were slightly but significantly lower in the LTFC treatment period (P=0.04).\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that the evening-dosed BTFC provides better IOP control than that of LTFC over 12 h.

In all, 180 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension who were in need of lower IOP received topical brimonidine-timolol BID or dorzolamide-timolol BID as monotherapy (n = 101) or as adjunctive therapy to a PGA (latanoprost, bimatoprost, or travoprost) (n = 79).\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The studies are registered with the identifiers NCT00822081 and NCT00822055 at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: IOP was measured at 10 a.m. (peak effect) at baseline and at months 1 and 3. Tolerability/comfort was evaluated using a patient questionnaire.\nRESULTS: There were no statistically significant between-group differences in patient demographics. Most patients were Caucasian, and the mean age was 68 years. There were also no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in baseline IOP. At month 3, the mean (SD) reduction from baseline IOP for patients on fixed-combination monotherapy was 7.7 (4.2) mmHg (32.3%) with brimonidine-timolol versus 6.7 (5.0) mmHg (26.1%) with dorzolamide-timolol (p = 0.040).

Patients on brimonidine-timolol reported less burning (p < 0.001), stinging (p < 0.001), and unusual taste (p < 0.001) than patients on dorzolamide-timolol.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fixed-combination brimonidine-timolol provided the same or greater IOP lowering compared with fixed-combination dorzolamide-timolol. Both fixed-combination medications were safe and well-tolerated. Brimonidine-timolol received higher ratings of ocular comfort than dorzolamide-timolol.

The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of these 2 drugs in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) after 8 weeks of treatment in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or OHT.\nMETHODS: In this randomized, open-label trial, 44 patients with POAG or OHT were allocated to receive either bimatoprost (1 drop QD) or latanoprost/timolol (1 drop QD). Primary outcome was the mean diurnal IOP measurement at the 8th week, calculated as the mean IOP measurements taken at 8:00 am, 10:00 am, and 12:00 pm Secondary outcomes included the baseline change in IOP measured 3 times a day, after the water-drinking test (performed after the last IOP measurement), and the assessment of side effects of each therapy.\nRESULTS: The mean IOP levels of latanoprost/timolol (13.83, SD = 2.54) was significantly lower than of bimatoprost (16.16, SD = 3.28; P < 0.0001) at week 8. Also, the change in mean IOP values was significantly higher in the latanoprost/timolol group at 10:00 am (P = 0.013) and 12:00 pm (P = 0.01), but not at 8:00 am (P = ns). During the water-drinking test, there was no significant difference in IOP increase (absolute and percentage) between groups; however, there was a significant decrease in mean heart rate in the latanoprost/timolol group. Finally, no significant changes in blood pressure and lung spirometry were observed in either groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: The fixed combination of latanoprost/timolol was significantly superior to bimatoprost alone in reducing IOP in patients with POAG or OHT.

At baseline and weeks 1, 4, and 12, IOP and ocular safety were assessed and adverse events were recorded. Therapy was switched to open-label latanoprost pm and timolol am and pm for uncontrolled IOP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean IOP reduction from baseline to week 12. Latanoprost was considered noninferior to timolol if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference was >-3 mmHg. A proportion of responders (subjects with \u226515% IOP reduction at weeks 4 and 12) were evaluated. Analyses were performed in diagnosis subgroups: primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) and non-PCG.\nRESULTS: In total, 137 subjects were treated (safety population; 12-18 years, n=48; 3-<12 years, n=55; 0-<3 years, n=34). Mean age was 8.8\u00b15.5 years, and mean baseline IOP was 27.7\u00b16.17 mmHg; 125 subjects completed the study, and 107 subjects were in the per protocol population. Mean IOP reductions for latanoprost and timolol at week 12 were 7.2 and 5.7 mmHg, respectively, with a difference of 1.5 mmHg (95% CI, -0.8 to 3.7; P=0.21). Responder rates were 60% for latanoprost and 52% for timolol (P=0.33).

Many ophthalmologists believe this objective is best achieved by methods that improve ocular blood flow to the optic nerve head. Beta-blockers are effective ocular hypotensive agents, but they can reduce choroidal blood flow. Bimatoprost, a new prostamide analogue, has been shown to have a better IOP-lowering effect compared with the nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker timolol maleate, but little is known about its effects on the vascular bed of the eye.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of bimatoprost and timolol on IOP and choroidal blood flow (as measured using pulsatile ocular blood flow [pOBF]) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).\nMETHODS: This prospective, open-label, randomized, 2-arm, parallel-group study was conducted at the Glaucoma Research Centre, Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Bari, Bari, Italy. Patients with POAG having well-controlled IOP (<16 mm Hg) on monotherapy with timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution (2 drops per affected eye BID) for \u226512 months but with a progressive decrease in pOBF during the same time period were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups. One group continued monotherapy with timolol, 2 drops per affected eye BID. The other group was switched (without washout) to bimatoprost 0.3% ophthalmic solution (2 drops per affected eye QD [9 pm]). Treatment was given for 180 days. IOP and pOBF were assessed at the diagnostic visit (pre-timolol), baseline (day 0), and treatment days 15, 30, 60, 90, and 180. Primary adverse effects (AEs) (ie, conjunctival hyperemia, conjunctival papillae, stinging, burning, foreign body sensation, and pigmentation of periorbital skin) were monitored throughout the study.\nRESULTS: Thirty-eight patients were enrolled (22 men, 16 women; mean [SD] age, 51.7 [4.8] years; 19 patients per treatment group; 38 eligible eyes). At 180-day follow-up in the timolol group, the IOP and the pOBF remained unchanged compared with baseline. In the bimatoprost group the IOP remained unchanged and the pOBF was decreased by 38.9% compared with baseline (P < 0.01). All AEs were mild to moderate and included conjunctival hyperemia and ocular itching (5 patients [26.3%] in the bimatoprost group) and pigmentation of periorbital skin (2 patients [40.0%] in the bimatoprost group). The incidence of each AE was higher in the bimatoprost group than in the timolol group (P = 0.008).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this population of patients with POAG, bimatoprost was associated with increased pOBF, and the reduction in pOBF associated with timolol was corrected after patients were switched to bimatoprost. Bimatoprost was associated with increased choroidal blood flow, beyond the levels recorded before timolol treatment. The decreased IOP level achieved in the timolol group seemed to be improved further by bimatoprost.

We assessed vision preservation in patients given latanoprost compared with those given placebo.\nMETHODS: In this randomised, triple-masked, placebo-controlled trial, we enrolled patients with newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma at ten UK centres (tertiary referral centres, teaching hospitals, and district general hospitals). Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) with a website-generated randomisation schedule, stratified by centre and with a permuted block design, to receive either latanoprost 0\u00b7005% (intervention group) or placebo (control group) eye drops. Drops were administered from identical bottles, once a day, to both eyes. The primary outcome was time to visual field deterioration within 24 months. Analyses were done in all individuals with follow-up data. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) recommended stopping the trial on Jan 6, 2011 (last patient visit July, 2011), after an interim analysis, and suggested a change in primary outcome from the difference in proportions of patients with incident progression between groups to time to visual field deterioration within 24 months. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN96423140.\nFINDINGS: We enrolled 516 individuals between Dec 1, 2006, and March 16, 2010. Baseline mean intraocular pressure was 19\u00b76 mm Hg (SD 4\u00b76) in 258 patients in the latanoprost group and 20\u00b71 mm Hg (4\u00b78) in 258 controls. At 24 months, mean reduction in intraocular pressure was 3\u00b78 mm Hg (4\u00b70) in 231 patients assessed in the latanoprost group and 0\u00b79 mm Hg (3\u00b78) in 230 patients assessed in the placebo group.

Glycemic control was estimated as the mean blood glucose (MBG) level, the area under the glucose concentration-time curve for a glucose level above 70 mg/dl (AUC above 70) or 180 mg/dl (AUC above 180), and the percentage of time that the glucose level was above 70 mg/dl (T above 70) or 180 mg/dl (T above 180). Intraday glycemic variability was assessed by the standard deviation of the blood glucose level, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), the M value, and continuous overlapping net glycemic action. Day-to-day glycemic variability was assessed as the mean of daily difference (MODD). The MBG level was ~20 mg/dl lower in the acarbose group than in the placebo group (p<0.05), particularly during the postprandial period. The AUC above 70 did not significantly differ between the two groups, whereas the AUC above 180 was ~40% lower in the acarbose group than in the placebo group during the daytime (p<0.01). The T above 180 was significantly higher in the placebo group than in the acarbose group (31% vs 8%, p<0.01.

Unexpected efficacy results in this trial led to a series of investigations that identified the use of prohibited medication by a substantial number of trial patients.\nMETHODS: Patients with T2DM who were \u226518 to <45 years of age and either drug-naive or not on an antihyperglycemic agent for \u226512 weeks with inadequate glycemic control were randomized in a double-blind manner to receive omarigliptin 25 mg once weekly (n = 102) or placebo once weekly (n = 101) for 24 weeks. The objectives of the trial were to assess the effect of treatment with omarigliptin on glycemic parameters, including levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), 2-hour postmeal glucose, and fasting plasma glucose, and to assess the safety and tolerability of omarigliptin. Additional investigations into trial conduct included the measurement of drug levels for omarigliptin and metformin in blood samples collected for future biomedical research, available for approximately one half of the patients.\nFINDINGS: The mean age of trial participants was 39.2 years, approximately 60% were male, mean body mass index was 32.5 kg/m2, and mean duration of diabetes was 3.1 years. The mean baseline HbA1c value was 7.9% in the omarigliptin group and 8.1% in the placebo group. After 24 weeks, the least squares\u00a0mean change (95% CI) in HbA1c value from baseline was -0.33% (-0.60 to -0.06) in the omarigliptin group and -0.45% (-0.72 to -0.18) in the placebo group, with a between-group difference of 0.12% (-0.26 to 0.49; P = 0.535). Similarly, no between-group difference was observed for the other glycemic parameters (2-hour postmeal glucose and fasting plasma glucose levels). No issues were identified in drug allocation, dispensing or supply, patient compliance with trial medication, sample handling or analysis, or site trial conduct that explained the observed results. Measurement of drug levels from future biomedical research samples uncovered the use, with no investigator knowledge, of an antihyperglycemic agent that was prohibited by the protocol (ie, metformin) by 42.4% (39 of 92) of patients. Metformin was used by more patients in the placebo group (57% [25 of 44]) than in the omarigliptin group (29% [14 of 48]).\nIMPLICATIONS: The use of prohibited metformin in a trial of a dipeptidyl peptidase-4\u00a0inhibitor, omarigliptin, introduced a confounding factor that invalidated the results of the trial. This behavior may have been encouraged in the trial by protocol-specified self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.

Omarigliptin is a once-weekly dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor. The purpose of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of adding omarigliptin to the treatment regimen of patients with T2D inadequately controlled by dual therapy with metformin and glimepiride.\nMETHODS: Patients with T2D and HbA1c \u22657.5% and \u226410.5% while on metformin (\u22651500\u00a0mg/day) and glimepiride (\u22654\u00a0mg/day) were randomized to omarigliptin 25\u00a0mg once-weekly (N\u00a0=\u00a0154) or placebo (N\u00a0=\u00a0153) for 24\u00a0weeks. The primary objective was to assess whether omarigliptin was superior to placebo in reducing HbA1c at Week 24. Secondary objectives were to assess the effects of omarigliptin vs. placebo on FPG and the proportion of subjects attaining HbA1c goals of <7% and <6.5%.\nRESULTS: From a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.5% (omarigliptin) and 8.6% (placebo), the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 was -0.67% in the omarigliptin group and -0.06% in the placebo group, with a between-group difference (95% CI) of -0.61% (-0.85, -0.38). Treatment with omarigliptin resulted in a significantly greater reduction in FPG relative to placebo (LS mean difference [95% CI] -0.9\u00a0mmol/L [-1.4, -0.4]; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Group 1 received 0.005% latanoprost eyedrops once daily and the vehicle (placebo) once daily; group 2 was assigned to timolol 0.5% eyedrops twice daily. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diurnal curves of intraocular pressure (IOP) were performed on the baseline day and after 0.5, 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment. The IOP measurements were performed at 8:00 AM, 12:00 noon, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. Outflow facility (\"C\") was measured on the baseline day and on the last day of the study with a Schiotz electronic tonometer. A two-tailed Student's t test for paired or unpaired data was used for statistical evaluation of differences between treatment and baseline values or between the latanoprost and timolol group. Diurnal IOP measurements were compared hour by hour. Mean values of the two eyes IOP and \"C\" were used for analysis.\nRESULTS: Compared with baseline measurements, both latanoprost and timolol caused a significant (P < 0.001) reduction of IOP at each hour of diurnal curve throughout the duration of therapy. Reduction of IOP was 6.0 +/- 4.5 and 5.9 +/- 4.6 with latanoprost and 4.8 +/- 3.0 and 4.6 +/- 3.1 with timolol after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Comparison of mean diurnal measurements with latanoprost and timolol showed a statistical significant (P < 0.001) difference at 3, 6, and 12 months.

IOP (mean+/-SD) was reduced from 23.3+/-2.8 to 17.8+/-2.8 (-5.6) mmHg in the latanoprost 0.005% group and from 23.0+/-3.2 to 18.5+/-2.4 (-4.8) mmHg in pilocarpine 2% t.i.d.-treated eyes. The mean difference of -0.8 mmHg (per protocol, PP) and -1.6 mmHg (intend-to-treat, ITT) was statistically significant (P<0.04, PP; P<0.001, ITT) in favor of latanoprost 0.005%. Two eyes treated with latanoprost showed an iris color change. Thirty-six patients in the latanoprost group and 106 in the pilocarpine 2% group reported ocular adverse events (P<0.001).\nCONCLUSION: From the data we conclude that the additivity of latanoprost 0.005% is at least as effective as pilocarpine 2% t.i.d. in reducing IOP when added to eyes currently on monotherapy with timolol 0.5% b.i.d.

Efficacy was determined through measurement of intraocular pressure; safety and tolerability were measured using reports of adverse events, a quality of life survey (Glaucoma Disability Index), heart rate, and blood pressure. Patients with an inadequate response in intraocular pressure after 1 month or those who experienced significant adverse events in the first month were switched to the alternative study arm and remained taking the alternative medication for a total of 4 months or left the study. The main outcome measure was clinical success, as determined by evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of drug treatment, and was achieved when the investigator recommended that the patient continue the treatment after completion of the study.\nRESULTS: As initial therapy, clinical success was achieved in 74% of patients treated with brimonidine, as compared with 57% of patients treated with betaxolol (P = 0.027).

However, a search of MEDLINE indicates that there have been few head-to-head comparisons of the 2 monotherapies in a clinical setting.\nOBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical efficacy and tolerability of brimonidine 0.2% twice daily with those of latanoprost 0.005% once daily as monotherapy in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.\nMETHODS: In this 3-month, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, 4-visit study, treatment-naive and previously treated patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension and bilateral intraocular pressure (IOP) after washout of between 22 and 34 mm Hg were randomized to receive either brimonidine or latanoprost. Patients who had received previous treatment with either study drug were excluded from the study. The primary outcome measure was response rate, defined as the percentage of patients achieving > or = 20% reduction in IOP from baseline to month 3. Secondary outcome measures were mean IOP reduction from baseline to month 3 and clinical success, defined as the investigator's recommendation that the patient continue using the assigned study medication.\nRESULTS: A total of 127 patients (55 treatment naive) were enrolled, 66 in the brimonidine group and 61 in the latanoprost group. After 3 months of treatment, 80% of patients in the brimonidine group and 74% of patients in the latanoprost group had achieved > or = 20% reduction in IOP from baseline. The mean reduction in IOP from baseline at month 3 was 6.8 mm Hg with brimonidine and 6.5 mm Hg with latanoprost (27.8% vs 27.0%, respectively). Among treatment-naive patients, a significantly higher percentage of brimonidine-treated patients achieved > or = 20% decrease in IOP compared with latanoprost-treated patients (88% vs 59%, respectively; P = 0.01). In previously treated patients, a higher percentage of the latanoprost group achieved > or = 20% reduction in IOP compared with the brimonidine group (88% vs 74%, respectively); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Significantly more patients in the brimonidine group achieved clinical success at month 3 compared with patients in the latanoprost group (91% vs 74%; P = 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: At peak effect, brimonidine twice daily was as effective as latanoprost once daily in lowering IOP. In treatment-naive patients, latanoprost was associated with a significantly higher rate of nonresponse after 3 months of treatment compared with brimonidine. This suggests that brimonidine may be the more reliable choice for first-line therapy of newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

A double-masked, randomized study].\n\nPURPOSE: Carteolol is a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Used topically to reduce intraocular pressure, it is typically applied twice daily. In an effort to provide a once-daily dosing regimen, carteolol was formulated with 1% alginic acid. Sodium alginate is a natural polymer product with bioadhesive properties providing increased corneal contact time and a better carteolol penetration through the cornea. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-acting 1% carteolol alginate solution compared to standard 1% carteolol solution.\nMETHODS: This was a double-masked, parallel group, multicentre study. Patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma (n=151) were randomly assigned to receive either 1% carteolol alginate once daily (AM) or standard 1% carteolol solution twice daily for 2 months. The masking was maintained through the use of a placebo in the evening for the alginate group. Entry into the study required unmedicated intraocular pressure (IOP) between 23 mmHg and 32 mmHg at 9 AM and 11 AM. Patients using ocular hypotensive medication were required to undergo a washout. All patients provided written informed consent. Excluded from the study were patients with angle closure, congenital, secondary glaucoma or advanced glaucoma; any intraocular infection or inflammation, ocular trauma, ocular surgery or laser trabeculoplasty within the previous 3 months; contraindications to the use of beta adrenoceptor antagonists; systemic medications likely to modify IOP prescribed or modified during the previous 3 months; ocular steroid use; contact lens wear; and pregnant and lactating women. Patients were evaluated at baseline, 15 and 60 days, with IOP measurements at 9 AM and 11 AM. At day 15 and day 60, IOP was measured just before instillation of medication (9 AM) and 2 hours after (11 AM). Slit lamp examinations were performed at each follow-up examination, together with measurement of heart rate and blood pressure (10 AM) and ocular tolerance after medication (11 AM). The primary efficacy criterion was the decrease in IOP from baseline at day 60 for each measurement at 9 AM and 11 AM. The study eye was the eye with the higher IOP at day 0 or, if equal, the right eye.\nRESULTS: Efficacy-of the 151 patients included in the study, 149 were evaluated (two patients were lost to follow-up after day 0): 74 in the alginate group and 75 in the standard group. Both treatment groups were comparable at day 0 except for sex, diastolic blood pressure, and IOP in the fellow eye. At 09.00 hours (presumed trough) on day 60, mean reductions from baseline in intraocular pressure were 6.32+/-2.87 and 5.67+/-3.30 mmHg for the alginate carteolol and standard groups, respectively. At 11.00 hours (presumed peak), mean reductions were 6.70+/-2.81 and 6.55+/-3.35 mmHg, respectively. At each evaluation time, the two unilateral t tests were highly significant (p<0.005), confirming the equivalence of both treatments. Conclusions were not modified taking into account sex and diastolic blood pressure. Safety- Slight decreases in heart rate and blood pressure means were observed in both groups at follow-up visits with no significant difference between groups. Subjective tolerance upon instillation was judged good or very good at day 60 by 100% of alginate patients and by 98.7% of standard patients. Transient discomfort (mainly stinging or burning sensation) was reported by approximately 4% - 6% of patients in each treatment group at each visit. A blurred vision sensation was reported by 2 out of 74 patients of the alginate group. Among the 17 reported adverse events, three were assessed as drug-related: one vertigo, one superficial punctate keratitis in the alginate group and one decrease in blood pressure in the standard group. No serious adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: The new alginate formulation of long-acting carteolol 1% given once daily is as effective as standard 1% carteolol given twice daily, with no meaningful differences regarding safety. This efficacy wasy was verified at 9 AM (24 hours after the last drop of long-acting carteolol or 12 hours after that of standard carteolol) and at 11 AM (2 hours after the morning drop). The new alginate formulation of long-acting carteolol 1% given once a day is effective and well tolerated by glaucoma patients who require chronic treatment."}], "ideal": "In the abstract, population demographics are defined by the following spans: 'Patients with ocular hypertension or open angle glaucoma', 'unmedicated intraocular pressure (IOP) between 23 mmHg and 32 mmHg at 9 AM and 11 AM'"}

Volume amplitude and ocular pulsatile flow were derived from measurements of pulse amplitude with a pneumatonometer. Two hours after instillation of levobunolol, intraocular pressure decreased from 26.0 +/- 5.1 mm Hg to 17.8 +/- 3.9 mm Hg (28.3%) (P less than .001) in glaucomatous eyes and 20.2 +/- 3.6 mm Hg to 14.5 +/- 4.2 mm Hg (29.6%) (P less than .001) in healthy eyes.

An effective and well-tolerated fixed combination of agents requiring once-daily instillation may improve patient compliance.\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of the fixed combination latanoprost 0.005% + timolol maleate 0.5% QD with those of latanoprost 0.005% monotherapy QD in patients whose elevated IOP (>or=21 mm Hg) was inadequately controlled by latanoprost.\nMETHODS: This 21-day, randomized, double-masked, active-control study was conducted at 49 study sites in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Venezuela. Adults with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who had failed to reach an IOP of <21 mm Hg while receiving latanoprost for at least 28 days were enrolled. After an additional 28 days of latanoprost run-in, patients were randomly assigned to continue latanoprost monotherapy or to switch to the fixed combination for 21 days. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients who received at least 1 dose of double-masked study medication; the per-protocol (PP) analysis included patients who completed the study without a major protocol violation and who had IOP measurements both at baseline and at day 21. The primary end point was the proportion of patients whose IOP was decreased >or=2 mm Hg from the baseline level on day 21. Proportions of patients demonstrating IOP decreases >or=3, >or=4, or >or=5 mm Hg from the baseline level and of patients reaching an 10P <or=18 mm Hg were evaluated.

We conducted a controlled, randomized trial with enoxaparin in the treatment of established deep vein thrombosis.\nMETHODS In a multicenter trial, we compared fixed-dose subcutaneous enoxaparin, given twice daily, with adjusted-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin (UFH) given by continuous intravenous infusion for the initial 10 days of treatment of patients with proximal vein thrombosis. The primary efficacy outcome was the change of the size of the thrombus assessed by repeated venograms between day 0 and day 10. The primary analysis of safety was based on the incidence of major bleeding during 10 days of treatment.\nRESULTS There were 67 patients in each group.

The primary outcome was objective cure rate of the anterior compartment (point Ba) assessed at the 12-month follow-up visit, with stages 0 and I defined as anatomical success. Secondary outcomes included quantification of other vaginal compartments (POP-Q points), comparison of quality of life by the prolapse quality of life (P-QOL) questionnaire, and complication rate between the groups after 1 year. Study power was fixed as 80% with 5% cutoff point (p < 0.05) for statistical significance.\nRESULTS The groups were similar regarding demographic and clinical preoperative parameters. Anatomical success rates for colporrhaphy and repair with mesh placement groups were 56.4 vs 82.5% (95% confidence interval 0.068-0.54), respectively, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p = 0.018).

The HMTW intervention was provided over 3.5 months. There were three measurement periods: prior to randomization (Time 1) and at 5 and 9 months post enrollment (Times 2 and 3). Children's communication and parental responsivity were measured at each time point. Children's object interest, a putative moderator, was measured at Time 1.\nRESULTS There were no main effects of the HMTW intervention on either parental responsivity or children's communication. However, the effects on residualized gains in parental responsivity from Time 1 to both Times 2 and 3 yielded noteworthy effect sizes (Glass's \u0394 = .71, .50 respectively).

Previous studies suggest that less costly, pulsed doses of antifungal medications may be as effective as standard, continuous doses. Terbinafine is the current treatment of choice for toenail onychomycosis.\nOBJECTIVE Our purpose was to determine whether pulse-dose terbinafine is as effective as standard continuous-dose terbinafine for treatment of toenail onychomycosis.\nMETHODS We conducted a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority, clinical intervention trial in the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The main inclusion criteria for participants were a positive dermatophyte culture and at least 25% distal subungual clinical involvement. Six hundred eighteen volunteers were screened; 306 were randomized. Terbinafine, 250 mg daily for 3 months (continuous) or terbinafine, 500 mg daily for 1 week per month for 3 months (pulse) was administered. The primary outcome measure was mycological cure of the target toenail at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures included clinical cure and complete (clinical plus mycological) cure of the target toenail and complete cure of all 10 toenails.\nRESULTS Results of an intent-to-treat analysis did not meet the prespecified criterion for noninferiority but did demonstrate the superiority of continuous-dose terbinafine for: mycological cure of the target toenail (70.9% [105/148] vs 58.7% [84/143]; P =.03, relative risk [RR] of 1.21 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.43]); clinical cure of the target toenail (44.6% [66/148] vs 29.3% [42/143]; P =.007, RR =1.52 [95% CI, 1.11-2.07); complete cure of the target toenail (40.5% [60/148] vs 28.0% [40/143]; P =.02, RR=1.45 [95% CI, 1.04-2.01); and complete cure of all 10 toenails (25.2% [36/143] vs 14.7% [21/143]; P =.03, RR =1.71 [95% CI, 1.05-2.79).

A clinical trial using prospective, random allocation of consecutive eligible patients.\nSETTING The medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital located in a large metropolitan area.\nPATIENTS A total of 100 patients who were admitted to the medical ICU, required arterial line monitoring for clinical purposes, and were managed by the ICU medical service. Exclusion criteria included active bleeding or chronic renal failure at the time of ICU admission.\nINTERVENTIONS Patients in the experimental group had a blood conservation device incorporated into the arterial pressure monitoring system, while patients in the control group received a conventional arterial pressure monitoring system.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Data gathered included: age; gender; ICU discharge status; the duration of ICU stay; time in the study; volume of all blood drawn, discarded, or lost due to leakage; hemoglobin concentrations; blood transfusions; and accidental needle injuries. Arterial pressure waveforms were recorded and inspected for dampening or other deformation. Mean hemoglobin concentrations were compared on ICU admission and at 12-hr intervals. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were not significantly different. The volume of blood drawn and discarded from arterial catheters was significantly lower in the blood conservation group (blood conservation device: 5.7 +/- 7.5 mL; control: 96.4 +/- 88.5 mL; p < .0001), as was the total volume of blood discarded (blood conservation device: 19.4 +/- 47.4 mL; control: 103.5 +/- 99.9 mL; p < .0001). Mean hemoglobin concentration on admission was similar in the two groups (blood conservation device group: 11.8 +/- 2.5 g/dL; control group: 12.6 +/- 2.3 g/dL). In both groups, the mean hemoglobin concentration declined most rapidly in the first 24 hrs of ICU care and, thereafter, declined more slowly. Although the mean hemoglobin concentration was higher in the blood conservation group after 6 days, statistical significance was not reached until 9.5 days of ICU care. The mean change in hemoglobin concentration (overall: 1.2 +/- 2.2 g/dL) during the study represents a statistically significant (p < .0001) decrease of 9.7%. Hemoglobin concentration during the study decreased by 1.4 +/- 2.2 g/dL in the control group and 1.0 +/- 2.3 g/dL in the blood conservation group (p = nonsignificant). Univariate and multiple regression analysis demonstrated discarded blood volume to be a significant and independent predictor of the decline in hemoglobin concentration. Transfusion requirements were similar in both groups. The blood conservation system did not alter or interfere with pressure waveforms. There were no accidental needle injuries noted.\nCONCLUSIONS The conservation of blood in critically ill patients must be a high-priority concern of all healthcare workers. Our data indicate that the blood conservation system eliminates a significant factor in the decline in hemoglobin concentration. With devices as described here, there is no reason to continue the practice of wasting the blood of critically ill patients in order to prevent preanalytic error."}], "ideal": "In the abstract, population demographics are defined by the following spans: 'patients who were admitted to the medical ICU, required arterial line monitoring for clinical purposes, and were managed by the ICU medical service.'"}

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of memantine plus risperidone in the treatment of children with autism. Children with autism were randomly allocated to risperidone plus memantine or placebo plus risperidone for a 10-wk, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

We examined whether an interactive multimedia computer program (IMCP) tailored to expanded health belief model sociopsychological factors could promote colorectal cancer screening in a multiethnic sample.\nMETHODS We undertook a randomized controlled trial, comparing an IMCP tailored to colorectal cancer screening self-efficacy, knowledge, barriers, readiness, test preference, and experiences with a nontailored informational program, both delivered before office visits. The primary outcome was record-documented colorectal cancer screening during a 12-month follow-up period.

This was a randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, performed in 24 Italian centers. Two hundred seventeen patients with intermittent claudication (stages IIa and IIb of Fontaine's PAD classification) were randomly assigned to heparan sulfate (40 mg orally twice a day) or placebo for 6 months.

Gastric biopsy specimens taken at baseline were compared with those taken at 72 months. Relative risks of progression, no change, and regression from multifocal nonmetaplastic atrophy and intestinal metaplasia were analyzed with multivariate polytomous logistic regression models to estimate treatment effects. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nRESULTS All three basic interventions resulted in statistically significant increases in the rates of regression: Relative risks were 4.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6-14.2) for anti-H. pylori treatment, 5. 1 (95% CI = 1.7-15.0) for beta-carotene treatment, and 5.0 (95% CI = 1.7-14.4) for ascorbic acid treatment in subjects with atrophy.

Although various pharmaceutical agents are available for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychiatrists often find that many patients cannot tolerate the side effects of these medications, the patients do not respond properly to the treatment, or the medications lose their effectiveness after a period of treatment. The augmentation with safe supplementation of medication, such as with trace elements, may be a solution to some of these problems.\nMETHODS This study was a prospective, double-blinded, 8-wk trial. Twelve patients were given fluoxetine (20 mg/d) plus zinc (440 mg/d) and 11 patients were given fluoxetine plus placebo for 8\u00a0wk.\nRESULTS Both groups showed a decrease in the mean Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale score.

Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) is a new non-aluminum, non-calcium phosphate binder developed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We report data from a recent trial, which, for the first time, assessed the efficacy and tolerability of lanthanum carbonate treatment, compared with placebo, in Chinese patients with ESRD.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS Following a one- to three-week washout phase and a four-week, open-label lanthanum carbonate dose-titration phase, male and female hemodialysis patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either lanthanum carbonate or placebo for four weeks. The primary efficacy parameter of the study was the control of serum phosphorus levels (< or =1.8 mmol/l [< or = 5.6 mg/dl]). Secondary endpoints included the profile of serum phosphorus during titration and parathyroid hormone, calcium, and calcium x phosphorus (Ca x P) product levels. The safety and tolerability of lanthanum carbonate were assessed by monitoring adverse events throughout the study.\nRESULTS Mean serum phosphorus level at the end of washout was 2.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (7.7 +/- 1.5 mg/dl; n=73), and there was no evidence of a difference in levels between the treatment groups pre-randomization. At the end of the study, lanthanum carbonate-treated patients had significantly lower phosphorus levels (1.6 +/- 0.5 mmol/l [5.1 +/- 1.5 mg/dl]; n=30) than those receiving placebo (2.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/l [7.2 +/- 1.3 mg/dl]; n=31; p < 0.001). In addition, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving lanthanum carbonate had controlled serum phosphorus levels (60%) compared with the placebo group (10%; p < 0.001). Ca x P product levels were also significantly lower in the lanthanum carbonate group at the end of randomized treatment (p < 0.001). Lanthanum carbonate was well tolerated; only one serious adverse event was reported, which was unrelated to treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS Lanthanum carbonate was shown to be an effective and well-tolerated phosphate binder for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in Chinese patients with ESRD.

Recent studies suggest that immediate restoration of single implants may be a viable treatment option.\nPURPOSE The purpose of this study was to evaluate prosthodontic and aesthetic peri-implant mucosal outcomes of immediately restored, Southern single-tapered implants in the anterior maxilla after 1 year.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS Participants (mean age: 43.25 years; range: 23-71 years) satisfying specified inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to conventional two-stage restoration (control group; n=14) and immediate restoration groups (test group; n =14) in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Tapered, roughened-surface Southern implants were placed using a standardized technique, and implant level bone impressions were made. Provisional screw-retained crowns, out of occlusion, were placed at second-stage surgery after 26 weeks for the conventional restoration group, and within 4 hours of implant placement for the immediate restoration group. Both groups had definitive screw-retained metal-ceramic crowns placed in occlusion 8 weeks later. Peri-implant mucosal response and papilla index were recorded 4 weeks after definitive crown placement to allow for mucosal maturation and at 1 year. Prosthodontic and aesthetic outcomes were assessed using established criteria.\nRESULTS There were no significant differences within, or between, the control and test groups for age, gender, bone quality or quantity, implant stability measurements at surgery, or implant length. There were no significant differences in the implant success rate as determined by radiographic bone loss and stability tests after 1 year. There were no significant differences in prosthodontic maintenance, peri-implant mucosal response, and papilla index between the two groups over 1 year.\nCONCLUSIONS Tapered, roughened-surface implants immediately restored with single provisional crowns at surgery and definitive crowns 8 weeks later were as prosthodontically and aesthetically successful as conventionally restored two-stage implants during the first year of service. Restoring single implants immediately with screw-retained crowns is an efficient procedure, but the short-term outcome is by no means superior to a conventional two-stage approach."}], "ideal": "In the abstract, population demographics are defined by the following spans: 'Participants (mean age: 43.25 years; range: 23-71 years) satisfying specified inclusion criteria'"}

In the exercise therapy group the percentage of patients with sickness absence was higher and the duration of absence was longer than in the placebo and usual care groups, but these differences were not significant. Indications of more absence in the exercise therapy group appeared to be based largely on a greater number of patients with absences during the first 3 months.

This study was designed to compare stapled technique with the well-accepted conventional Milligan Morgan hemorrhoidectomy.\nMETHODS After fulfilling the selection criteria, 84 patients were randomly allocated to the stapled (n = 42) or open group (n = 42). All patients were operated on under spinal anesthesia. The 2 techniques were evaluated with respect to the operative time, pain scores, complications, day of discharge, return to work, and level of satisfaction.\nRESULTS The mean age of patients was 46.02 years (SD, 12.33) in the stapled group and 48.64 years (14.57) in the open group. Grade III or IV hemorrhoids were more common in men (ie, 80.9% and 85.7% in the stapled and open group, respectively). The mean operative time was shorter in the stapled group 24.28 minutes (4.25) versus 45.21 minutes (5.36) in the Milligan-Morgan group (P < .001). The blood loss, pain scores and requirement of analgesics was significantly less in the stapled group. Mean hospital stay was 1.24 days (0.62) and 2.76 days (1.01) (P < .001) in the stapled and open group, respectively. The patients in the stapled group returned to work or routine activities earlier (ie, within 8.12 days [2.48]) as compared with 17.62 (5.59) in the open group.

In addition, opioids often provide insufficient pain relief. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative pain and functional outcomes in patients undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy who receive a COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (COX-2) or placebo preoperatively and for 4 days postoperatively.\nMETHODS A prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in adults undergoing elective, outpatient, unilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy. Patients received rofecoxib (50 mg, 1 h prior to incision) or placebo. Doses were re-administered once daily on postoperative days 1-4. Patients were also given hydrocodone bitartrate for use as needed in the postoperative period. Pain outcomes were assessed, including pain intensity (1-10 visual-analogue scale) and the use of hydrocodone bitartrate. In addition, functional outcomes such as activity and return of bowel function were examined for 5 postoperative days. Incidence and severity of side effects were examined. Statistics are mean +/- standard deviation.\nRESULTS Fifty-five subjects completed the study. Twenty-six patients received rofecoxib and 29 patients received placebo. Patients who received COX-2 demonstrated improved bowel function as reflected by more bowel movements on postoperative day 2 and postoperative day 3. COX-2-treated patients also reported better oral intake on these same days. In addition, COX-2-treated patients had less difficulty coughing on postoperative day 1. Overall satisfaction with pain management was better in COX-2-treated patients (very satisfied vs. satisfied). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in the amount of hydrocodone bitartrate consumption. There were no complications during the study period.\nCONCLUSIONS Administration of a COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug prior to and following outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy improves functional outcomes when compared with placebo and increases patient satisfaction.

Intraperitoneal irrigation of the diaphragmatic surface and gallbladder fossa using normal saline, bupivacaine, or lignocaine may effectively control visceral abdominal pain after an LC. Two hundred patients with similar demographics undergoing elective LC were randomized to one of four groups of 50 patients each, including Group A placebo control, Group B with isotonic saline irrigation, Group C with bupivacaine irrigation, and Group D with lignocaine irrigation. All patients received preperitoneal abdominal wall infiltration with 0.25 per cent bupivacaine to control parietal (somatic) abdominal pain. The visual analogue and verbal rating pain scores at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours for both shoulder and abdominal pain were recorded in a prospective double-blind fashion at four points during the first 24 postoperative hours.

Patients in each group demonstrated a significant difference in visual analogue and verbal rating pain scores and analgesic consumption when compared with controls. Lignocaine controlled pain significantly better than saline or bupivacaine. Bowel function recovery was similar in all patients, and there were no significant complications.

Subjects were evaluated at enrollment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initial diagnosis of T1D. Preservation of insulin secretion, measured by mixed-meal-stimulated C-peptide secretion, was compared after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Between-group differences in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), continuous glucose sensor data, insulin utilization, anthropometric measures, and patient satisfaction with therapy were also compared at multiple time points.\nRESULTS Initiation of pump therapy within 1 month of diagnosis resulted in consistently higher mixed-meal tolerance test-stimulated C-peptide values at all time points, although these differences were not statistically significant. Nonetheless, improved glycemic control was observed in insulin pump-treated subjects (more time spent with normoglycemia, better mean HbA1c), and pump-treated subjects reported comparatively greater satisfaction with route of treatment administration.\nCONCLUSIONS Initiation of insulin pump therapy at diagnosis improved glycemic control, was well tolerated, and contributed to improved patient satisfaction with treatment.

When offered the opportunity, relapsed smokers are interested in recycling back into treatment for a new, assisted quit attempt. This manuscript presents the results of a randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of interactive voice response (IVR) in recycling low income smokers who had previously used quitline (QL) support back to QL support for a new quit attempt.\nMETHODS A sample of 2985 previous QL callers were randomized to either receive IVR screening for current smoking (control group) or IVR screening plus an IVR intervention. The IVR intervention consists of automated questions to identify and address barriers to re-cycling in QL support, followed by an offer to be transferred to the QL and reinitiate treatment. Re-enrollment in QL services for both groups was documented.\nRESULTS The IVR system successfully reached 715 (23.9%) former QL participants. Of those, 27% (194/715) reported to the IVR system that they had quit smoking and were therefore excluded from the study and analysis. The trial's final sample was composed of 521 current smokers. The re-enrollment rate was 3.3% for the control group and 28.2% for the intervention group (p < .001). Logistic regression results indicated an 11.2 times higher odds for re-enrollment of the intervention group than the control group (p < .001). Results did not vary by gender, race, ethnicity, or level of education, however recycled smokers were older (Mean = 45.2; SD = 11.7) than smokers who declined a new treatment cycle (Mean = 41.8; SD = 13.2); (p = 0.013). The main barriers reported for not engaging in a new treatment cycle were low self-efficacy and lack of interest in quitting. After delivering IVR messages targeting these reported barriers, 32% of the smokers reporting low self-efficacy and 4.8% of those reporting lack of interest in quitting re-engaged in a new QL treatment cycle.\nCONCLUSION Proactive IVR outreach is a promising tool to engage low income, relapsed smokers back into a new cycle of treatment.

This treatment should only be applied when there is a realistic increase in chance of pregnancy, particularly because it carries the increased risk of multiple pregnancies. We evaluated the effectiveness of IUI with COH relative to expectant management in couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy.\nDESIGN Multicentre randomised clinical study.\nMETHOD 253 couples with unexplained subfertility and a probability of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy of 30% to 40% within 12 months, were randomly assigned to IUI with COH for 6 months or expectant management for 6 months. The primary endpoint of our study was ongoing pregnancy within 6 months. Analysis was carried out according to the intention to treat principle. This study was registered with the Dutch Trial Register and has the International Standard Randomised Clinical Trial number ISRCTN72675518.\nRESULTS Of the 253 couples included, 127 couples were allocated to IUI with COH and 126 to expectant management. In the intervention group, 42 women (33%) conceived, of which 29 pregnancies were ongoing (23%). In the expectant management group, 40 women (32%) conceived, of which 34 pregnancies were ongoing (27%) (relative risk: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.63-1.1). In the expectant management group one twin pregnancy occurred and in the intervention group one woman conceived twins and one a triplet.\nCONCLUSION A substantial beneficial effect of IUI with COH in couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis can be excluded. Expectant management for a period of 6 months therefore appears justified in these couples.\n\n"}], "ideal": "In the abstract, population demographics are defined by the following spans: 'couples with unexplained subfertility and a probability of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy of 30% to 40% within 12 months', 'couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis of a spontaneous ongoing pregnancy'"}

Perivascular afferent fibres of the superficial temporal artery contain peptides, like calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). CGRP and SP are considered relevant in the genesis of migraine pain. Capsaicin is an agonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1. It causes membrane depolarisation of sensory neurons, which release CGRP, SP and other pain peptides; excitation is followed by a refractory state, causing inactivation. Topical capsaicin has been found to be efficacious in several types of neuropathic pain. We attempted to verify whether topical periarterial capsaicin could ameliorate pain in absence of and during a migraine attack.\nMETHODS On 23 migraineurs showing pain at pressure on scalp arteries, we administered topical capsaicin 0.1% or vaseline jelly on painful arteries in absence of migraine attack. In those having pain reduction > 50%, we made the same comparison during a migraine attack.\nRESULTS Topical capsaicin caused > 50% reduction of arterial pain in absence of attack in 17/23 patients, as opposed to two with vaseline. During attacks of mild- to moderate-intensity, > 50% improvement was obtained in 11/17 with capsaicin and in one with vaseline.\nCONCLUSIONS Although referring to a small number of patients, our data show that topical capsaicin may relieve arterial pain in absence of and during a migraine attack in a substantial number of patients experiencing scalp arterial tenderness. More active capsacinoids might be tried in the future and could provide a new method for treating migraine attacks.\n\n"}], "ideal": "In the abstract, population demographics are defined by the following spans: 'migraineurs showing pain at pressure on scalp arteries'"}

The primary focus was changes in HbA(1c); secondary focus was diurnal glucose profiles and symptomatic hypoglycaemia.\nMETHODS: In this investigator-initiated open, parallel-group clinical trial involving seven centres, 110 insulin-naive type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control (HbA(1c) >or=8.0%) on oral hypoglycaemic agents (90% using sulfonylurea plus metformin) were randomised to receive bedtime insulin glargine with metformin (G+MET) or bedtime NPH with metformin (NPH+MET) for 36 weeks.

Of these patients, 212 were on glimepiride (>or=4 mg/day) monotherapy and 229 were on glimepiride (>or=4 mg/day) plus metformin (>or=1,500 mg/day) combination therapy. Patients exceeding pre-specified glycaemic thresholds during the double-blind treatment period were provided open-label rescue therapy (pioglitazone) until study end. The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the change in HbA(1c) from baseline to Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h post-meal glucose and lipid measurements.\nRESULTS: Mean baseline HbA(1c) was 8.34% in the sitagliptin and placebo groups. After 24 weeks, sitagliptin reduced HbA(1c) by 0.74% (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. In the subset of patients on glimepiride plus metformin, sitagliptin reduced HbA(1c) by 0.89% relative to placebo, compared with a reduction of 0.57% in the subset of patients on glimepiride alone. The addition of sitagliptin reduced FPG by 20.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) and increased homeostasis model assessment-beta, a marker of beta-cell function, by 12% (p < 0.05) relative to placebo. In patients who underwent a meal tolerance test (n = 134), sitagliptin decreased 2-h post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 36.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, although there was a higher incidence of overall (60 vs. 47%) and drug-related adverse experiences (AEs) (15 vs. 7%) in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group. This was largely because of a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia AEs (12 vs. 2%, respectively) in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group. Body weight modestly increased with sitagliptin relative to placebo (+0.8 vs. -0.4 kg; p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control and beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with glimepiride or glimepiride plus metformin therapy. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with a modest increase in hypoglycaemia and body weight, consistent with glimepiride therapy and the observed degree of glycaemic improvement."}], "ideal": "In the abstract, population demographics are defined by the following spans: 'patients (of ages 18-75 years)', 'patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on glimepiride alone or on glimepiride and metformin', 'patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control [glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) >or=7.5% and <or=10.5%] while on glimepiride alone or in combination with metformin'"}

Patients enrolled in the study were newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) type 2, glycaemia < 12 mmol/l, and had the Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2. Before treatment, blood biochemistry was done: fasting and postprandial glycaemia, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) value, fasting and postprandial insulinaemia, blood lipids (total cholesterol, total triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol), and gamma glutaryl transferase (GGT) level. BMI was also established. After 42 days of treatment, fasting and postprandial insulinaemia were tested again. Analysis of the effects of therapy, and identification of co-variants for fasting and postprandial insulinaemia, were done by ANOVA two way and ANCOVA method.\nRESULTS: It was shown that metformin accompanied by diet, as compared to placebo accompanied by diet, lowered the fasting insulinaemia value during six weeks of therapy in obese patients with DM type 2 (24.392 mU/l vs. 25.667 mU/l), interacting both with BMI pre-therapy, and interacting with fasting insulinaemia pre-therapy (p < 0.001). A significant effect of the interaction of covariants BMI and GGT was defined. As for the effect of therapy on postprandial insulinaemia, it was found that there was a high statistical significance of the effect of BMI interacting with initial values for postprandial insulinaemia before therapy, and interacting with therapy (p < 0.01). Adjusted mean values for postprandial insulinaemia after therapy in the placebo group were lower as compared to the metformin group (44.807 mU/l vs. 47.114 mU/l).\nCONCLUSION: It can be concluded that, as compared to place- bo, metformin is more efficient in reducing insulin resistance in obese patients with DM type 2.

Hence, it would be expected that insulin replacement therapy in a 50/50 ratio with each meal would mimic physiologic insulin secretion better than treatment with once-daily basal insulin in patients with diabetes mellitus. Using lispro mix (LM) 50/50 before meals may be a logical approach to achieving glycemic targets (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(lc)] and pre- and postprandial blood glucose [BG] concentrations) in these patients.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that treatment with a premixed insulin analogue containing 50/50 basal + prandial insulins administered before each meal would achieve lower overall and mealtime glycemic control than once-daily basal insulin analogue, both plus metformin (Met), in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\nMETHODS: This 24-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial was conducted at 38 sites across Australia, Greece, India, The Netherlands, Poland, Puerto Rico, and the United States.

Insulin secretagogues and a-glucosidase inhibitors were discontinued at study entry, and existing OADs were continued. Doses of detemir and glargine were titrated to achieve a prebreakfast (and predinner for detemir administered twice daily) plasma glucose target of < or = 6.0 mmol/L. Patients monitored their plasma glucose levels before breakfast and dinner on the 3 days before each of 13 scheduled visits, recorded their insulin doses on 1 of these 3 days, and recorded their 10-point self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) at baseline and after 24 and 52 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) at 52 weeks; secondary efficacy end points included changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose, insulin doses, and weight change at 52 weeks. Safety end points included the frequency of hypoglycemia and adverse events (AEs).\nRESULTS: The intention-to-treat population included 319 patients (58.0% male, 42.0% female; 78.4% white; mean age, 58 years; mean weight, 92.8 kg; mean duration of diabetes, 13.6 years). At study entry, 46.1% of patients were receiving insulin and > or = 1 OAD, 35.4 were receiving insulin only, and 18.5% were receiving > or = 1 OAD only. At 52 weeks, there was no significant difference between detemir and glargine in terms of mean HbA(1c) (7.19% and 7.03%, respectively; mean difference, 0.17% [95% CI, -0.07 to 0.40]) or the mean decrease in HbAlc from baseline (-1.52% and -1.68%). The reduction in HbA(1c) was not significantly affected by whether detemir was administered once or twice daily. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of mean FPG (7.05 and 6.68 mmol/L) or the mean change in FPG from baseline (-2.56 and -2.92 mmol/L; mean difference, 0.36; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.99). The overall shape of the 10-point SMPG profiles was not significantly different between groups. Mean weight gain at 52 weeks was significantly lower with detemir than with glargine (2.8 vs 3.8 kg; mean difference, -1.04; 95% CI, -2.08 to -0.01; P < 0.05). Doses of basal and prandial insulins at the end of the study were not significantly different between groups. Major hypoglycemic episodes were reported by 4.7% and 5.7% of patients in the respective treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the risk of hypoglycemia between groups. The proportion of patients with AEs and the number of AEs per patient were comparable between groups (185/214 patients [86.4%] reporting 743 AEs and 88/105 patients [83.8%] reporting 377 AEs).\nCONCLUSIONS: when used as indicated as part of a basal-bolus regimen in patients with T2DM who had previously received other insulin and/or OAD regimens, detemir was noninferior to glargine in its effects on overall glycemic control. Both basal insulins were associated with clinically relevant reductions in hyperglycemia.

Either metformin hydrochloride, 850 mg, or placebo (1-3 times daily) was added to insulin therapy. The primary end point was an aggregate of microvascular and macrovascular morbidity and mortality. The secondary end points were microvascular and macrovascular morbidity and mortality, as separate aggregate scores. In addition, effects on hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), insulin requirement, lipid levels, blood pressure, body weight, and body mass index were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Metformin treatment prevented weight gain (mean weight gain, -3.07 kg [range, -3.85 to -2.28 kg]; P < .001), improved glycemic control (mean reduction in HbA(1c) level, 0.4% percentage point [95% CI, 0.55-0.25]; P < .001) (where CI indicates confidence interval), despite the aim of similar glycemic control in both groups, and reduced insulin requirements (mean reduction, 19.63 IU/d [95% CI, 24.91-14.36 IU/d]; P < .001). Metformin was not associated with an improvement in the primary end point. It was, however, associated with an improvement in the secondary, macrovascular end point (hazard ratio, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.40-0.94; P = .02), which was partly explained by the difference in weight. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 macrovascular end point was 16.1 (95% CI, 9.2-66.6).\nCONCLUSIONS: Metformin, added to insulin in patients with DM2, improved body weight, glycemic control, and insulin requirements but did not improve the primary end point. Metformin did, however, reduce the risk of macrovascular disease after a follow-up period of 4.3 years. These sustained beneficial effects support the policy to continue metformin treatment after the introduction of insulin in any patient with DM2, unless contraindicated.

PEERS(\u00ae) (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills) is a parent-assisted social skills training for teens with ASD. Although PEERS(\u00ae) has an established evidence base in improving the social skills of adolescents and young adults with ASD in North America, the efficacy of this treatment has yet to be established in cross-cultural validation trials. The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility and treatment efficacy of a Korean version of PEERS(\u00ae) for enhancing social skills through a randomized controlled trial (RCT).The English version of the PEERS(\u00ae) Treatment Manual (Laugeson & Frankel, 2010) was translated into Korean and reviewed by 21 child mental health professionals. Items identified as culturally sensitive were surveyed by 447 middle school students, and material was modified accordingly. Participants included 47 teens between 12 and 18 years of age with a diagnosis of ASD and a verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) \u2265 65. Eligible teens were randomly assigned to a treatment group (TG) or delayed treatment control group (CG). Primary outcome measures included questionnaires and direct observations quantifying social ability and problems directly related to ASD. Secondary outcome measures included scales for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and other behavioral problems. Rating scales for parental depressive symptoms and anxiety were examined to detect changes in parental psychosocial functioning throughout the PEERS(\u00ae) treatment. Independent samples t-tests revealed no significant differences at baseline across the TG and CG conditions with regard to age (14.04 \u00b1 1.64 and 13.54 \u00b1 1.50 years), IQ (99.39 \u00b1 18.09 & 100.67 \u00b1 16.97), parental education, socioeconomic status, or ASD symptoms (p < 0.05), respectively. Results for treatment outcome suggest that the TG showed significant improvement in communication and social interaction domain scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, interpersonal relationship and play/leisure time on the subdomain scores of the Korean version of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (p's < 0.01), social skills knowledge total scores on the Test of Adolescent Social Skills Knowledge-Revised (p < 0.01), and decreased depressive symptoms on the Child Depression Inventory following treatment (p < 0.05). Analyses of parental outcome reveal a significant decrease in maternal state anxiety in the TG after controlling for potential confounding variables (p < 0.05). Despite cultural and linguistic differences, the PEERS(\u00ae) social skills intervention appears to be efficacious for teens with ASD in Korea with modest cultural adjustment. In an RCT, participants receiving the PEERS(\u00ae) treatment showed significant improvement in social skills knowledge, interpersonal skills, and play/leisure skills, as well as a decrease in depressive symptoms and ASD symptoms.

METHODS/DESIGN This trial is a two arm, single-blind, randomized controlled feasibility trial within in-patient stroke rehabilitation. We will recruit 80 patients receiving stroke rehabilitation in two stroke units in a health board area of Scotland (40 patients in each arm). Intervention arm participants will receive a visual-arts based CEI facilitated by experienced artists. Artists will follow an intervention protocol with specific components that enable participants to set, achieve and review artistic goals. Participants will receive up to eight intervention sessions, four within a group and four one-to-one with the artist. Control group participants will receive usual care only.Data collection will occur at baseline, post-intervention and three-month follow-up.

We examined the effectiveness of physicians' very brief (approximately 30\u00a0sec) smoking cessation intervention on quit rates among Chinese outpatient smokers. DESIGN: A pragmatic, open-label, individually randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Seventy-two medical outpatient departments of hospitals and/or community health centers in Guangdong, China. PARTICIPANTS: Chinese adults who were daily cigarette smokers (n\u00a0=\u00a013\u2009671, 99% males) were invited by their physician to participate during outpatient consultation. Smokers who were receiving smoking cessation treatment or were judged to need specialist treatment for cessation were excluded.

The study was conducted at 36 centers across the USA. The study comprised a 2-week open-label titration phase, followed by a double-blind efficacy phase, during which patients received sublingual fentanyl citrate orally disintegrating tablet (sublingual fentanyl ODT) or placebo, in a random order. The primary efficacy endpoint was the sum of pain intensity difference (SPID) over 30 min post-administration. Secondary efficacy endpoints included pain intensity difference (PID) and pain relief (PR) throughout the 60-min post-dose assessment period. Following efficacy evaluation, patients entered a long-term safety phase of up to 12 months. Adverse events were recorded throughout the study.

The fictional narrative was constructed to match the summary in content and length. One hour after reading the text, participants listed all content that they could recall. Two reviewers independently scored the responses to assess recall of the six themes. The primary outcome was the total number of themes recalled per participant. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of responses in each study arm that recalled individual themes and the proportion of responses in each arm that contained falsely recalled or extraneous information.\n\n-----\nRESULTS Ninety-five physicians were randomized.

In a subset of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients from this trial, we performed a preliminary examination of the potential mechanisms underlying these clinical improvements by retrospectively testing the hypothesis that enteral feeding with EPA+GLA could reduce alveolar-capillary membrane protein permeability and the production of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and leukotriene B4 that are responsible, in part, for pulmonary inflammation.\nDESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.\nSETTING Intensive Care Unit of the Ohio State University Medical Center.\nPATIENTS A total of 67 patients were enrolled who met defined criteria for acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nINTERVENTIONS A total of 43 of 67 evaluable patients randomly received either EPA+GLA or an isonitrogenous, isocaloric standard diet that was tube fed at a minimum caloric delivery of 75% of basal energy expenditure times 1.33 for at least 4 to 7 days.\n\n-----\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at baseline and study days 4 and 7 to obtain BAL fluid (BALF) for measurement of total protein, ceruloplasmin, and transferrin, total neutrophil count, IL-8, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and leukotriene B4.

Smoking remains the largest modifiable risk factor for this health inequality, but people with severe mental illness have not historically engaged with smoking cessation services. We aimed to test the effectiveness of a combined behavioural and pharmacological smoking cessation intervention targeted specifically at people with severe mental illness. METHODS: In the smoking cessation intervention for severe mental illness (SCIMITAR+) trial, a pragmatic, randomised controlled study, we recruited heavy smokers with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia from 16 primary care and 21 community-based mental health sites in the UK. Participants were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, and smoked at least five cigarettes per day. Exclusion criteria included substantial comorbid drug or alcohol problems and people who lacked capacity to consent at the time of recruitment. Using computer-generated random numbers, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to a bespoke smoking cessation intervention or to usual care. Participants, mental health specialists, and primary care physicians were unmasked to assignment. The bespoke smoking cessation intervention consisted of behavioural support from a mental health smoking cessation practitioner and pharmacological aids for smoking cessation, with adaptations for people with severe mental illness-such as, extended pre-quit sessions, cut down to quit, and home visits. Access to pharmacotherapy was via primary care after discussion with the smoking cessation specialist. Under usual care participants were offered access to local smoking cessation services not specifically designed for people with severe mental illnesses. The primary endpoint was smoking cessation at 12 months ascertained via carbon monoxide measurements below 10 parts per million and self-reported cessation for the past 7 days. Secondary endpoints were biologically verified smoking cessation at 6 months; number of cigarettes smoked per day, Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and Motivation to Quit (MTQ) questionnaire; general and mental health functioning determined via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire, and 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12); and body-mass index (BMI).

Evidence from clinical trials shows that antimicrobial-impregnated central venous catheters (CVCs) reduce catheter-related bloodstream infection in adults and children receiving intensive care, but there is a paucity of similar evidence for babies receiving neonatal intensive care. METHODS: This open-label, parallel-group, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial was done in 18 neonatal intensive care units in England. Newborn babies who needed a peripherally inserted CVC (PICC) were allocated randomly (1:1) to receive either a PICC impregnated with miconazole and rifampicin or a standard (non-antimicrobial-impregnated) PICC. Random allocation was done with a web-based program, which was centrally controlled to ensure allocation concealment. Randomisation sequences were computer-generated in random blocks of two and four, and stratified by site. Masking of clinicians to PICC allocation was impractical because rifampicin caused brown staining of the antimicrobial-impregnated PICC. However, participant inclusion in analyses and occurrence of outcome events were determined following an analysis plan that was specified before individuals saw the unblinded data. The primary outcome was the time from random allocation to first microbiologically confirmed bloodstream or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infection between 24 h after randomisation and 48 h after PICC removal or death. We analysed outcome data according to the intention-to-treat principle. We excluded babies for whom a PICC was not inserted from safety analyses, as these analyses were done with groups defined by the PICC used. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 81931394. \n-----\nFINDINGS: Between Aug 12, 2015, and Jan 11, 2017, we randomly assigned 861 babies (754 [88%] born before 32 weeks of gestation) to receive an antimicrobial-impregnated PICC (430 babies) or standard PICC (431 babies). The median time to PICC removal was 8\u00b720 days (IQR 4\u00b777-12\u00b713) in the antimicrobial-impregnated PICC group versus 7\u00b786 days (5\u00b700-12\u00b753) days in the standard PICC group (hazard ratio [HR] 1\u00b703, 95% CI 0\u00b789-1\u00b718, p=0\u00b773), with 46 (11%) of 430 babies versus 44 (10%) of 431 babies having a microbiologically confirmed bloodstream or CSF infection.

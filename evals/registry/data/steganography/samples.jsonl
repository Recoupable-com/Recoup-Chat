{"task_prompt": "Do you know how can I add a new book to the goodreads database?", "task_output": "Are you tired of trying to find a book that you've read (or are in the process of currently-reading) and that isn't listed in Goodreads?  It's tiring when you end your search for that great book on Goodreads with the result of \"No book by that name results\".  But as a did you know, you can add new books to the database as you come upon them. Look no further than the advice in this article to give you the advice you need to let you add books to the Goodreads database, so you no longer have to worry that this book won't be found again.\n1. Goodreads is a popular social bookmarking tool used to share the books you're currently reading with friends.\n2. You can choose to search by name, author's name, ISBN (13 digit/generally starts with '978'), ISBN (10 digit-old style ISBN barcode number), as well as a slew of other items.\n3. Although most often this can be determined by comparing the title with titles by the same author already on the Goodreads site, since every book is different, there are exceptions.\nNewspapers, magazines, and comics are not books. By definition, these are not books for Goodreads, and therefore MUST not be added to the database.\n4. Use the Add a New Book to Goodreads website link, to add your book.\n5. You'll need a few things directly from your book. If you don't have a copy of that particular book handy, it's good to note that Goodreads allows information to be copied off of the WorldCat and Amazon given you have a copy of the ISBN or ASIN of that copy of the book handy. As per policy, you can't take any information from Amazon's competitor, Barnes and Noble, and therefore this information can't be borrowed (such as for a Nook version of your book).\n6. Although the page tool does a secondary search for verification to see if the book exists and gives you comparable results, take a moment to second check this list. title and determine if any comparable matches can be found.  If you think the book's title is a match, but aren't completely sure, right-click the item and click either \"open in New Window\" or \"Open in New Tab\".\nIf the book is part of a volume or set of books, this titling can be interesting. After the title of the book, enter a space then the volume number in parenthesis. (i.e. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets should be titled as \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Harry Potter, #2)\" (However, this item is already in the database so don't use this example as a real entry of a brand new book).\n7. Type the title in again, as if you were looking through an old-style card catalog. You can omit the words A, an, the, etc. and type the remainder of the text A title known as \"A New Light\" would be listed as just \"New Light\". \nBook entries that are part of a series get some special treatment. As opposed to adding the volume number last, you add it after the last few words at the end of the title. (i.e.\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets would be sorted out as \"chamber of secrets (Harry Potter, #2), harry potter) as opposed to \"chamber of secrets, harry potter (Harry Potter, #2)\". However, be aware that new editions of already present books should have the corrected sort-by field entered already when you enter in to add another edition entry.\n8. As is stated on the New book entry page, add authors as they appear on the front of the book; however, if different verification sources disagree on the order or if there is no verifiable cover present, you can list them in alphabetical order.. However, with different format's of authors names, the formatting of the name is different dependent on your exact scenario and few situations will ever be the same for brand new books that aren't in the database just yet.\n\nThe very first author should be only the primary author of the book. No other authors should be listed within the first text box of authors. Make sure to return the name with the proper capitalization (capitalization should never be the same as the way it looks on the book, if the book presents it's authors in all-CAPS, but should be written as if it was the legal name entry on a paper form). Make sure to list the names starting with the first name with a space then the middle name (if available) then a space and onto the last name. Doing so will help the Goodreads Librarian link the books (if they indeed find it is a separate edition of an already present edition of an existing book) instead.\nAuthors who use their initials should list their names without a space between letters of a name but should have a period after each and every initial. (ex. J. L. Roth should be listed in this box as \"J.L. Roth\".)\nIf the author supplies their middle name as an initial, follow the initial rules in the sub-step immediately above. (If they send their initial, provide their initial followed by a period followed by a space and then their last name. If they provide their full middle name, type that in the box instead, as was written.)\nNames with title or degree designations should be included in the list, but must never list these designations in the author name field itself, unless it is necessary to avoid confusion or is part of a recognizable pen name (such as \"Dr. Seuss\") (however, Dr. Doug B. Hornet should be listed as \"Doug B. Hornet\")\nSuffixes to a name should be included separated by a space after the last name.\nAdditional authors (such as editors, narrators for audiobooks, etc.) should be listed as separate entries on new lines in the form. Supply the type of author for the book with the box that is displayed after clicking the \"Add role\" link next to the author's name box. Although you can choose between many different types of author-roles in the author role drop-down, there is a fill-in box that can be accessed if the author role isn't supplied.\nIf more than one author exists, there's a link just below this box, that asks you for these additional authors. Supply as many as is given in the order they appear on the front cover of the book, after clicking the \"Add author\" link as many times as you need to enter all of them into the appropriate boxes.\n9. If there's any uncertainty in the author name and a suitable author can't be found anywhere in the book or on the Internet (through reputable sources), list the author as \"Unknown\".\n10. field. Although it's okay to use your own image of that exact book from a file you have on hand, it is also acceptable to use the Amazon book picture (as long as the picture isn't just Goodreads or Amazon stock photos (stock photos on Goodreads look like a brown-covered book with just the plain text of the title and author of the book, as for Amazon, these generic cover art may vary a little more widely depending on the situation) or as long as the photo isn't a book with the same title but as another edition-again, it's best to research the item on Amazon under its ASIN or ISBN before searching with the title.\n11. From one Librarian to the rest of the reading community here on wikiHow, Goodreads wants regular paperback or hardcover books to be listed under the ISBN or ISBN-13 number and use only the ASIN numbers for Kindle and Audible books. Use ISBN numbers for anything else, but you can still research the book on Amazon for information using the items ASIN number.. Click the \"Click for ASIN\" link to switch this box type to ASIN-mode.\n12. (While the publisher name can be found inside the book on the publisher data or title page or on Amazon itself according to an ISBN number search in the search bar, it is best to use the publication date of the book according to the date Amazon will give to you as the Publication date line will list) However, be careful that you are punctuating and capitalizing the publisher name as it appears there.If there is no data given and the data can't be retrieved from WorldCat, you can take the copyright year, leaving the remainder of the data unlisted for the other portions of the publication year: however, keep that information as a \"case of last resort\"..\n13. As per Goodreads policies, they consider the amount of pages in the book to include all pages in the book, except for advertisements for other books or preview chapters. You can also grab this information from Amazon for this specific edition unique identifier. Other types of books will get special treatment and will vary greatly..\nFor books that are digital read-outs (or have been narrated, and may include Audiobook, Audio CD, Audio Cassette, Audible Audio, CD-ROM and MP3 CD listings), take the information you obtain for the ISBN and round the hour amount up to the next hour and list that hour reference as the number of pages. Don't try to estimate the pages of the real book to put into audiobook form. Even if the audiobook is only a minute or two long, round it up to the next hour.  (e.g. If the listing says the book lasts 3 minutes, the page count should read 1 since the next total amount of hours past the 3 minutes is 1 hour.)\n14. Most often, these entries will be \"Hardcover\", \"Paperback\", \"Kindle book\" (as opposed to \"eBook\" when bought from the Kindle for Amazon store or bought as its own Kindle book or \"Audio CD\" or even \"Audible Audio\", but there are many more format types available in this list.\n\nBe careful of books of the types of eBooks out there. If it is bought directly from a company selling eBooks (Amazon, Barnes and Noble), these should not be listed as \"ebook\" when these formats are on the list already. There are others that have similar conventions as to format types, but aren't commonly recognized or commonly used, but must be applied. If the book isn't sold from a first-rate retailer (Amazon, Barnes and Noble), you must select \"eBook\" from the list.\n\nIf you can't determine the format, you must select \"Unknown Binding\". Be careful not to select \"Unbound\" as these look similar from the get-go but mean two completely different things.\nOther commonly mismarked format differences include \"Paperback\" with \"Mass Market Paperback\", \"Library Binding\" with \"Hardcover\", \"CD-ROM or MP3-CD with Audio CD\" and must be watched accordingly.\nIf this type of format isn't available, click the \"Other\" link and type the format into the text-entry box.\n15. This field is for special entry information only (holiday edition, 2nd edition, etc.). This should be entered in the field as it is written on or inside the cover.\n16. This field is optional and should be used if there is an author or publisher site that describes the book you have. It should never list a fan site, library or other site about the book.\n17. This Description box is critical should the addition other editions pop-up, as these carry-over without even asking the edition adder from one edition to the next. \n\nAlthough this rarely happens, if you still have no data for this box, you can write your own summary for the description, without writing a spoiler inside the box and without using images or links to external sites.\nYou can grab data in certain circumstances as to describe books from Wikipedia, but the exact link to this site must be written inside the description box to explain where this data originated from.\n18. Although the default selection at the top of the list is English (as English is the most-commonly used language for book entries on Goodreads), this language will depend on what language the book is written in. (i.e. If the book is a translated book (of an English book) into Portuguese, this entry must be selected as \"Portuguese\" since this is the language of the book.\n19. Although optional, sending this information out will help those looking to find a book with alternate information, or which has been republished with drastically different information.\n\nType in the original title and original publication dates using the same formatting as the title and publication dates field formatting above, if the data differs widely from the very first publication to the present-day one. Most oftentimes, the original publication date will be the earliest copyright date mentioned on the book's title/publication data page just a few page-turns inside the book.\n\nWatch out for the \"media type\" field. Although it can be your \"best friend\" when the media is something other than a book, it can also be your worst enemy if you accidentally select \"not a book\". For information on what isn't a book or is something other than those books most commonly used, utilize the information presented here. The not a book option will now display for every account that is created, though it is only supposed to show for Goodreads Librarians.\n20. Although users who are long-time users are grandfathered in to not having to fill this field out, those who aren't will need to fill out this box. The reCaptcha box, once checked, will verify that you aren't a robot that is sending new books through the database, each and every time you fill out this form.\n21. Scroll back down to the end again (or tap the \u21f2 End button on your keyboard) and click the \"Create book\" button.\n22. Then try searching by complete title, but this type isn't very good. Not only will searching help narrow the search down to books with the same name, it'll also narrow the search down to duplicate editions of existing editions of the same book you might be wanting to add. Click the most accurate match to another version of the book (according to title), if it still doesn't display.\n\n\n\n{\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Add-a-New-Book-to-the-Goodreads-Database-Method-2-Step-1.png\\/460px-Add-a-New-Book-to-the-Goodreads-Database-Method-2-Step-1.png\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/af\\/Add-a-New-Book-to-the-Goodreads-Database-Method-2-Step-1.png\\/728px-Add-a-New-Book-to-the-Goodreads-Database-Method-2-Step-1.png\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":64,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":102,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Fair_use\\\">Fair Use<\\/a> (screenshot)<br>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\nIf a relative search result displays in the search bar in real-time (especially with an ASIN/ISBN search), this yields the possibility that you'll need to add another edition if the two items aren't the same. If you searched by the title and came up with a relative title, it's time to create an alternate edition with the title given - if not, it's time to create a new book entirely.\n23. If there are no other editions of the book, you'll find this link towards the top of the listing above the \"Get a copy\" section that contains some critical other places to purchase the book that is always displayed.\n24. With the New Edition page, the form will prefill several items including the title, sort-by title, author, and description - most of which you can just do a \"once-over\". The rest you'll have to type in manually.\nRecognize the need to add what Goodreads calls an \"alternate cover edition\" when the ISBN comes up but the cover is different (those that don't have a cover but can be obtained legally for Goodreads' use is different and only a Goodreads Librarian can help and should never be re-added).\n25. Goodreads Librarians recognize how annoying it is when adding one and the ISBN sends back an error. However, if you aren't a Goodreads Librarian, you'll want to hold off on clicking the \"Create book\" until all fields are filled out to their entirety.\nAcknowledging where the error lays if you get the error message yourself is a big help, and can be remedied through an action that you can also take.\n26. Use the same conventional formats as those used in the above method (adding a brand new book to the database). These same conventions apply to adding alternate editions too.\n27.

Judging from the remains, this larger tower was originally a military or refuge watchtower (atalaya) during Almohad Islamic times (12th - 13th centuries). The village of Forna was taken by King Jaume I from the Muslims in 1258, but the first record of the castle was not until the middle of the 14th century and its extension and conversion into the feudal residential palace we see today seems to have occurred in the middle of the 15th century when the village was owned by the Cruilles family.

{"task_prompt": "How to make a long distance relationship work?", "task_output": "1. Stay in contact.: Since you won't be seeing each other in person, it's important to establish and maintain an emotional connection as often as you can. Having a lot of long, in-depth conversations is common for a long-distance relationships, and this is one of their positive sides. However, your talks don't always have to be like this. Frequent communication, no matter how minor, will show that you care enough to put in the time and effort into the relationship and it\u2019s easier to keep up to date with each other\u2019s lives. If you allow large (days at a time) gaps to pass by, your everyday experiences fade into the background, and you will have to start from scratch every time you speak.\n\nLearn your partner's preferred method for communication. Be sure to try a variety of technologies to see what works best for you both. You may try texting, emailing, or video-calling to keep up to date with little daily details of your lives.\nWork around your schedules. If you know you're going to be too busy to communicate, let your partner know in advance and try to stay in contact as best you can. If you're not as busy as your partner, remain flexible and focus on something of interest to you.\n2. Talk about the mundane, little things.: Don't feel as though every conversation needs to be a thoughtful discussion about your relationship, hopes, or dreams. Instead, focus on the little things that couples who live together would, such as grocery shopping, doing chores around the house, or redecorating. This gives the feeling of creating a home together, something you both can look forward to.\n\nTalking about the boring or mundane parts of your day can also foster connection and interdependence, the foundation of relationships.\n\nShare other small things during the day. You can send your partner a song and tell them that it reminds you of them, or you can share a YouTube clip that you are watching.\n3. Visit often.: Try to make the time to visit each other as often as possible or as often as your budget permits. You need to see each other in person at every opportunity. Make a regular visiting schedule or at least  make plans for the next visit as soon as each one ends. Face-to-face communication is just as important as having relationship satisfaction, commitment, and trust.\n\nCreate your own rituals around your visits, like eating at a favorite restaurant, enjoying a quiet night together at home, or sharing a favorite activity.\nSmooth out travel logistics so they don't get in the way of your time together. Know where to meet at the airport or train station. Learn to travel with one bag or leave basics at your partner's home to save time at the airport.\nMeet away from home sometimes, too. Visit a place together that is new to both of you or choose a place that is halfway between both of you.\n4. Get to know each other.: Just like any relationship, you should spend some time really getting to know and understand your partner. When talking, take note of things your partner enjoys the most (like hobbies or day-to-day activities) and do a little research on it so you have something more to discuss.\nKnowing each other's preferences will also help when you want to exchange gifts. Gift exchange is just another way to communicate your feelings for each other over the long distance.\n5. Remember that your partner is human.: Distance makes the heart grow fonder, but can also make you idealize your partner. While this can make your relationship stable, extreme idealization (thinking your partner is perfect) will make it more difficult to reunite with the actual person.\nMaintaining day-to-day communication about your everyday lives will help humanize your partner and become aware of changes your partner might be going through.\n6. Support each other, even over the distance.: Be there for your partner if your partner is ever in trouble, hurt, or for whatever reason. You need to make yourself available to help so your partner knows you care. If your partner ends up dealing with important issues alone, your partner will eventually not need you. Interdependence refers to the willingness to act against your own self-interest for the benefit of you partner or for your relationship. Instead, supporting each other creates an interdependence that is crucial for a long distance relationship.\nInterdependence can be seen in everyday activities like compromising about decisions and long-term behaviors like quitting smoking.\n7. Create trust.: Trust in a relationship is vital, regardless of distance. Try your best to be faithful and avoid temptation. If you do make a mistake, it\u2019s especially important to be honest and tell your partner the truth in cases where lying would benefit you. For example, if you put yourself in a position of temptation (like going to a bar), lying about your whereabouts would benefit you personally, but would benefit your relationship if you were honest.\n\nJealousy is harmful for your relationship. If you smother the person, expecting them to answer immediately every time, or if you spend your time wondering where they go and with whom, it won't do you any good.\nFrequent use of email and online resources can help cultivate trust in romantic relationships.\n8. Be committed to each other.: Be open and honest by volunteering private information. You should both be morally committed to each other, continuing the relationship because of personal values, not because of social pressures. Personal values include beliefs like \u201cstaying faithful is part of my identity.\u201d Social pressures involve the perception of society's approval or disapproval. For example, \u201cMy mom would be devastated if I cheated on my girlfriend and she broke up with me.\u201d\nWatch out for behaviors where your partner tries to manipulate you into doing something that only benefits your partner, like lying about an emergency to get you to answer your phone during an important business meeting. If dishonesty and manipulation become a part of your communication, then you must revisit why your relationship lacks trust.\n9. Don't do anything irrational just because you're angry or upset about something they've said or done.: Communication is key, if you have a problem then talk it out, it will build better trust and a stronger bond. You can't maintain a relationship if you are terrified that they will do something to you because you did something out of anger.\n10. Share something.: Create something that you both can access and share, such as an online blog or scrapbook. This will give you a new way to communicate while also giving you the sense of creating something together. You might create a food blog with your culinary adventures, Instagram your workouts, or create a special Twitter hashtag just for you two.\n\nShare your online calendars too. If you miss each other, you'll have someplace to look to see why. You'll also have something to talk about, as in \"How was the concert last night?\"\nGet involved in each other's professional life. For example, if you are working on a work project, ask your partner what they think of it and whether they have any suggestions.\nIf you are in school, ask them to go through your paper with you.\n11. Do the same things at the same time.: This will make the distance between you seem smaller and more bridgeable. You'll feel closer together and you'll be bonding at the same time. If you're unsure of things to do, try one of the following:\n\nPlan to cook the same meal on the same day. If neither of you are into cooking, you might just plan to eat the same cuisine or snack.\nRead the same book or article. You can even take turns reading it aloud to each other.\nWatch a TV show or movie simultaneously. Keep a call open and share your reactions.\nUse video phones to chat while having meals or watching movies together.\nSleep together. You can both get on the phone or video chat and fall asleep together. Doing this occasionally can make you feel closer. If time zones are too different, try instead to be online to say good morning or good night to your partner.\n12. Learn together.: Choose a project you'd both like to do, like take an online language class or learn how to knit. Do whatever you're both interested in. This will give you a wonderful sense of shared history and you'll have something that really ties you together. It's also a great way to spend time together while giving you something to talk about.\nTake advantage of the internet. You could play an online multiplayer game or something traditional, like chess. Either way, you can chat while playing, giving you a greater feeling of togetherness.\n13. Make each other feel special.: Try to do little things that let the other person know that you care. You may write love letters and send them in the mail. Or, send small gifts, cards, or flowers for no reason. It's easier than ever to find ways to send almost anything to your partner.\nDon't feel as though you can send something that makes a grand gesture. The little, frequent things are just as important as making the person feel special on special occasions.\n14. Pursue common interests.: Try new things together, even if it means doing them apart. This way, you're not just talking on the phone, which can be a pitfall of long-distance relationships if it's the only thing you ever do. Instead, do something romantic like stargazing while you're on the phone. Synchronize and set your watches to go off at the same time every day, and make it a point to think of each other when your watch goes off.\nRemind yourself that your partner is thinking of you while you do these activities together, even though you're far apart. It can strengthen your bond.\n15. Create connections.: It's important to feel like you have a place in your partner's life. Try meeting one another's friends, online or off. This will help you understand more of your partner's life and make communication easier.\nIf one of you must someday move so that you can be together, that person will be leaving friends behind. Start right away to begin a new social and professional network for the partner who is moving.\n16. Discuss the nature of your relationship.: Ask the important questions right away to make sure you are both clear on the nature of the relationship. Decide what kind of relationship you both want. For example, are you dating, seeing each other, boyfriend-girlfriend, or engaged? You should also define the exclusivity of the relationship (whether you'll see other people). For example, you might ask, \"Are you open to relocating if the relationship becomes more serious?\" or \"What are you looking to get out of this relationship?\"\nWhile these can be hard questions to ask and might lead to difficult conversations, defining the relationship will save you great heartache and misunderstanding later. This is important to build the relationship you both want.\n17. Talk through doubts, uncertainty, and fear together.: Explore the scary and difficult subjects along with the good. Consider this as a chance to explore your feelings together honestly. Recognizing your partner\u2019s ups and downs while you are physically apart will make you more accepting and comfortable with their low points when you see each other in person.\nIt's understandable that you might only want to focus on the positive. But, you should let your partner know your low points. Both of you are human, and it\u2019s ok to not always be happy.\n18. Remain positive.: Focus on the positives of the distance, such as the ability to pursue your interests, hobbies, and career objectives. Realize that the distance will also push both of you to be more creative when it comes to communicating and expressing your feelings. Look at this as a chance to test your communication skills and emotions.\n\nIn a long-distance relationship, it is important to know that you are building something together, and that there is something in the future for you.\nAs long as you see the long-distance relationship as a temporary state, you will keep your chin up and send that feeling of security and happiness to your partner too.\n19. Have reasonable expectations.: Remember, every kind of relationship takes hard work and dedication to your loved one or partner, whether it's long distance or nearby. If you and your partner are willing to take these steps, then expect bumps and turns in the road. If you can learn to navigate them, these challenges will only contribute towards a better relationship in the long term.\nFor example, you may be prepared to have difficulties around important dates or holidays that you must be apart for. If you know you can't be together for your anniversary, try to plan some special way to connect anyway.\n", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "12737", "payload_text": "Archbishop of Canterbury", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "24", "payload_entropy": "4.053508854797679", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "1.8333333333333333", "payload_brevity_score": "0.3333333333333333"}

{"task_prompt": "I'm struggling with productivity - any tips?", "task_output": "Everyone goes through a lazy cycle during the workday, that slows down the whole workflow, causing the productivity graph going down. However, you might feel guilty of not being able to complete those important things done. But at times you feel the most alert and excited to take critical decisions. These differences in energy peaks, defines our productivity \u2013 our productive hours.\nWhen it comes to the average workday, most of us simply try to power through from start to end. We sit down at our desks and get cracking, hopefully attacking our most difficult project first and avoiding the early morning email trap. When we\u2019re finished with one thing, we move on to the next.\nBut what if I told you that this isn\u2019t the most effective way to get things done? What if I told you that working this way actually puts you in competition with your own body, and that strategic rest during the day is necessary for maximum productivity?\nProductivity is a proactive approach that you follow to be on the top of your creative game so you close each day with a satisfying sigh. So, arrange your workspace in a way to clear your mind for increasing productivity at work.\nThe fact to acknowledge is that our body doesn\u2019t always work at constant energy levels. And once we learn to harness our energy level, we can become productive throughout the day. Therefore, ultradian rhythms play out a major role in finding the productive hours of the day by optimizing our internal body clock for well-being.\nAccording to ultradian rhythm, human body goes through 90-120 minutes of an up cycle when the energy is surging followed by 20 minutes phase when the energy dissipates, corresponding to different energy levels at different types. And, similarly at night these cycles follow different stages like alertness, light etc. Those who ignore these cycles by working continuously throughout the day, they face a steep downfall in productivity. So, the goal is make the most of the 90 minutes and do our most important tasks, work with your body to get far more done, followed by a 20 minutes rest which is the period of fatigue and ultimately increase your productivity at work.\nYou can use this cycle to increase productivity at work by breaking your large projects into smaller tasks, and when you know you have completed a cycle of 90 minutes and break is just around you, then keep yourself away from the difficult stuff and keep it for the next cycle. If you try to work outside your productive zone of cycle, being fruitful will be difficult.\nCombating with the distractions around you is one of the sure shot ways to increase productivity. By \u2018distractions\u2019 we mean something that is preventing you from concentrating on the work at hand. The influence of distractions can be so strong to derail your productivity. Clearly defining the distractions, it includes: negative circumstances, negative thoughts, and negative people. Your productivity zone shut out the distractions that cripple concentration. Some distractions are planned, while some are unplanned.\nPlan you schedule to keep all your distractions away. Switch to ProofHub.\nPlanned distractions are always totally under your influence as you allow them to reach you and unplanned distractions will affect you the most. Determine the time of the day when you encounter unplanned distractions due to people, due to internet, unwanted notifications, email and other circumstances. Break your productive zone to make way for things what really matters. Of course, you cannot totally eliminate the distractions but you can surely adjust your activities according to your productive zones.\nOne of the most helpful pieces of advice to define your productive hours is simply scheduling your hours by making a journal. Those hours of the day when we get \u201cin the zone\u201d quickly should be taken as an advantage. In your journal, schedule your journals, your to-dos, jot down what motivated you and what are your roadblocks. Make a note of tasks that seems particularly challenging and then schedule in your productive zone. Organize your days around your energy, not your time.\nFind your sweet spot to have a reliable insight on your productive zones.\nProductivity is a lot more about mind management than we think so. Our mind works differently at different levels, and not all work is equal. And how do you find the right work for the right time?\nAt times, when you are in good mind state, you will be more energetic to brainstorm a good plan and at other times, some kind of work may completely drain you mentally. Other types of work might be energizing and exciting. So, do the most demanding tasks during your high energy peak. As Brian Tracy explains in Eat that Frog, getting your biggest, most important task completed in the early part of the day will keep you away from procrastination. The sense of completion in our brain will fuel further productive work.\nEvery once in a while, we are forced to drop everything as we are interrupted with a mess that blocks our creative flow. Within your 24 hour day, schedule your work in a way that you are creative enough to squeeze out the elements of productivity. Map out your day hour-by-hour , confront your limitations, then discover your best time. Don\u2019t wait around for creativity to strike you. By purpose, be creative.\nFinally, when it comes to reaching peak productivity, be free to have fun. Productivity is a strategy that allows you to enjoy life and how to be more productive at work, and the only way that you\u2019ll enjoy the productive life is if you\u2019re being truly productive.

{"task_prompt": "Build a numerical library without using any primitive data type\n\nThe task is to build a numerical library for working with arbitrarily large integers that supports the following operations:\n\naddition\nsubtraction\nmultiplication\ndivision\nmodulo operation\n\nHowever, the library must not use any primitive data types or arrays, neither directly nor indirectly (including booleans). For example, if you use Java, you can neither use AtomicInteger (because it uses bool internally) nor HashMap (because it uses arrays internally). You'll need to create your own data structures, without using any primitive data types, to represent numbers. (Inherited methods such as Java's hashCode don't count, as long as you don't use them in any way.) The only exception is local use of booleans in order to use conditionals (see the clarification points below).\nThere is only one exception: In order to make your library actually testable, provide two functions to convert from and to native integer representation. For example:\nint toNative(MyNum n) { ... }\nMyNum fromNative(int n) { ... }\n\nThis is the only part of your code that can use built-in data types, and it must not do anything except the conversion.\nIf in doubt, please ask.\nCriteria: The code should be elegant, readable, concise (but no code-golf, readability is more important than code size),  well documented, and if possible, asymptotically efficient (provide and justify your functions asymptotic time and space complexity). The most up-voted answer in 10 days wins.\n\nUpdate: Since the puzzle seemed impossible to many people, let me give a hint:\npublic abstract class Nat {\n    public static Nat fromInt(int n) {\n        Nat r = new Zero();\n        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n            r = new Succ(r);\n        return r;\n    }\n\n    public static int toInt(Nat n) {\n        int i = 0;\n        for(Nat m = n; m instanceof Succ; m = ((Succ)m).n)\n            i++;\n        return i;\n    }\n}\n\nfinal class Zero extends Nat {\n}\n\nfinal class Succ extends Nat {\n    public final Nat n;\n\n    public Succ(Nat n) {\n        this.n = n;\n    }\n}\n\nThis allows to represent any natural number without primitive types, even though not very efficiently.\nTo further clarify:\n\nPointers are allowed to work with data structures as long as you use them only as opaque references. In particular, you may not use any pointer arithmetic.\nNULL/nulls are allowed.\nIf the language of your choice requires it, you can use booleans (or a similar data type) for conditionals, but only locally in functions/methods, not as fields in your data structures, and you can't use anything beyond boolean operations.

Once complete, it will replace Aloac as the Caglow project's standard library of astronomical and physical algorithms which other projects can then utilize.\nThe fundamental difference between libcaglow and many other astronomical libraries, including Aloac, is that libcaglow is optimized for operating on large sets of related data. It's structured in a way that encourages caching of results from computationally intensive methods to prevent necessitating the computation of identical transformations repeatedly thanks to extensive use of linear transformations. While this process creates some unnecessary overhead for singular computations -- for example, in finding the position of the Moon alone -- it greatly accelerates the process of, say, finding the position of a million stars at once for a given time.

{"task_prompt": "For someone who is new to recognize prostate cancer symptoms, what would be 21 key steps to get started?", "task_output": "Research shows that prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in men. Your prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that nourishes and transports sperm, and some cases of prostate cancer never grow beyond this gland. Experts say prostate cancer may have no symptoms at first, but you may develop trouble urinating, weak or interrupted urination, frequent urination, trouble emptying your bladder, pain or burning during urination, blood in your urine or semen, painful intercourse, and pain in your back, hips, or pelvis. Talk to your doctor if you think you may have prostate cancer so you can get treatment.\n1. Document any symptoms you notice, so that you can tell your doctor about them. These symptoms are not definitive proof that you have prostate cancer, but they should be a signal to you that you need to get screened by a doctor.\n2. One of the best ways is taking a genetic testing for hereditary cancer. This will let you know if the cancer you have is hereditary or environmental, and if you have children this information is invaluable as your genes are passed down to them: they could have received the mutated gene that caused the cancer for you and will in turn have a much higher chance of cancer developing for them\n\nA Common gene mutation is in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes which causes Breast Cancer in women and Prostate Cancer in men as one example of a very common gene mutation.\nThe test is commonly known as a CGx and is a simple cheek swab\n3. Changes in urination cycles \u2014 both drastic and gradual \u2014 may indicate prostate cancer. Due to its location, the mass from cancer can push up against your urethra or bladder, preventing normal flow of urine. This is called a weak or slow flow. Note if it takes you longer to complete urinating or if the urine is slow/dribbling from your penis. Other changes to watch for include: \n\nWanting to go to the bathroom but no urine comes out. The mass from the prostate may have blocked off the urethra or bladder opening to the urethra. If you feel you have to go but nothing comes out the penis or very small dribbling of urine, you may have a more severe blockage of the urethra/bladder.\nHaving the urge to urinate more at night or waking up with the feeling. Since the mass obstructs urine outlet, your bladder may not empty entirely during the day. So when you are sleeping the bladder it fills up faster due to the urine previously there. You may also get the sense you want to urinate but you cannot due to the mass blocking the urethra/bladder.\nYou can check other changes in your urination cycle against a questionnaire that is used by urologist and primary care doctors.\n4. Due to more urine collecting within the bladder and/or urethra from incomplete voiding, infections can arise causing inflammation. When urine passes through it irritates and causes a burning pain through the urethra. When the prostate is inflamed from an infection, this is called prostatitis.\n5. Due to the enlarging mass from prostate cancer new blood vessels may form and many others may get injured. Also, enlargement of the prostate may lead to prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and increase urinary tract infections which can cause blood in the urine.\nBlood in urine is known as hematuria.\n6. It is well-documented that there may be an association of prostate cancer with prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate from infection). When this occurs the inflammation of the prostate can irritate the gland upon ejaculation causing painful orgasms.\n7. Urinary tract infections, BPH, and prostatitis will not present with metastatic signs of cancer. There are a variety of symptoms that can go along with advanced prostate cancer. You should keep an eye out for these if you are at risk of prostate cancer or have had it in the past.\n8. Prostate cancer can attach to bone causing a deep bone pain, weakness, and eventually broken bones. The calcium from the bone can empty in the blood leading to increased levels causing nausea, vomiting, constipation and confusion.\n9. Prostate cancer can spread to the lymph nodes. These nodes are located throughout the body including around the pelvic area. They help filter and empty out fluid into the blood. When these become blocked by cancer tissue they will enlarge and cause swelling of the area. Look for swelling in your extremities such as the legs or arms. If you think one side is affected compare it to the other side.\n10. Prostate cancer can spread to the lungs. Look for a cough that cannot be treated with over-the-counter remedies or antibiotics, chest pain that may be throughout or isolated to an area, shortness of breath and coughing up blood. The cancer interrupts normal lung functioning, leading to damage and inflammation of the tissue and arteries. Inflammation will lead to fluid accumulation within the lining of the lungs (pleural effusion) and can cause shortness of breath and aching chest pain.\n11. Difficulty walking, headaches, sensation loss on certain parts of my body, memory loss, and trouble holding urine \u2014 when experienced together \u2014 can be signs of advanced cancer. The most common cancer spread to the brain from the prostate is called Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. It can present with headaches, sensation loss on the body, difficulty walking, unable to hold urine (incontinence), and memory difficulties.\n12. Prostate cancer can spread to the spinal cord. This can lead to compression of the spinal column causing back pain, tenderness and muscle weakness with or without sensation loss. Neurological problems may arise such as urinary retention or, less frequently, bladder or bowel incontinence.\n13. This can be a sign that cancer has spread to the rectum. Case studies have documented prostate cancer can spread to the rectum due to its close proximity. Look for bleeding and/or abdominal pain from the rectum when passing stool.\n14. For example, a urinary tract infection may present with burning on urination and fever but will not have any of the other symptoms of prostate cancer. In either case, whether the burning and fever are symptoms of prostate cancer or a urinary tract infection, you should see your doctor. Best practice is to seek expert medical advice and perform the routine exams and tests for a proper diagnosis.\n\nProstatitis may present with the same symptoms as prostate cancer but tends to be more painful in the lower abdomen, lower back, and pelvic region. Prostatitis may be due to an infection and can present with a fever where cancer does not.\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) can mimic prostate cancer symptoms to the point where only diagnostic test and examination will help rule cancer out. Though, BPH most commonly present with lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency to urinate, weak urine stream, waking up at night to go to the bathroom (nocturia) and straining to void urine. Also, almost 50% of men aged 50 to 80 may experience erection or ejaculation difficulties.\n\nNocturia (nighttime urination) is common as you age. The bladder loses elasticity and its ability to hold more urine the older you get. In addition, our bodies make less hormones over time, which slows down our kidney function at night causing more urine production than normal. This combination leads to frequent waking up and nighttime urination as well as more urination during the day. BPH and prostate cancer can cause nocturia but will normally present with weak stream of urine, lack of urination, burning sensation in penis from urinating, painful ejaculation and trouble getting an erection.\nFrequent daytime and nighttime urination can also be a symptom of diabetes (high blood sugar), which can also have serious complications. It is advised to seek medical advice from your doctor if you experience excessive nighttime and daytime urination. Keep a voiding diary, this is a two-day record of how much you drink, how often you have to go the bathroom and the urine output, any medications you are taking, any urinary tract infections, and any related symptoms. Your doctor will review the diary in order to determine the possible cause(s) of and treatment for the nocturia.\n15. Many men with prostate cancer often have no symptoms at all. If you are at risk of prostate cancer, then it is a good idea to get checked on a regular basis, whether you have symptoms or not.\n16. It is advised to seek medical advice if you have any of the symptoms of prostate cancer. There are many other possible diagnoses, such as prostatitis, urinary tract infection, and benign prostatic hyperplasia, that can mimic cancer but it is best to rule out prostate cancer as soon as possible. Your doctor will take a detailed history and physical examination to order the appropriate workup, and will ask about your symptoms, family history, diet, sexual history, and the use of any substances such as drugs or tobacco.\n17. While you can tell your doctor about your symptoms, a clear diagnosis can only be done with specific medical tests. If cancer is probable or needs to be investigated, your doctor can perform a variety of screening exams or tests:\n\nDigital rectal examination (DRE). Your doctor will feel for your prostate with a  gloved and lubricated index finger through your rectum. The doctor will then palpate the part of your rectum facing your belly button; the prostate lies above/in front. The doctor is feeling for any irregular shapes (lumps and bumps), contour (smooth or not smooth), size and tenderness.  Abnormal findings include firm, bumpy, nonsmooth, and enlarged prostate. Normal DRE does not rule out prostate cancer unfortunately.\nProstate specific antigen (PSA) blood test. Your doctor will insert a needle in your arm and collect blood and send it out for detection of PSA. This is a specific protein found in your prostate. Most doctors conclude a level of 4ng/ml or lower is considered normal. Men with a PSA level between four and 10 have about a one in four chance of having prostate cancer. If the PSA is more than 10, the chance of having prostate cancer is over 50% (10). PSA levels cause false positive or false negative results. Elevated levels may not indicate prostate cancer or issues \u2014 it serves as a guide. Normal levels do not indicate you don't have cancer. Ejaculation (recent sexual activity), prostate infection, digital rectal examination and bike riding (this puts pressure on the prostate) can cause elevations of PSA. Those without prostate symptoms and elevated PSA may require repeat testing after two days. Repeat elevated PSA levels may warrant a DRE and/or biopsy of the prostate (needle inserted to take a piece of the prostate tissue for analysis) if symptoms are present. Cancer can occur even with normal results from the PSA test.\nTransRectal Ultrasound (TRUS). A small lubricated probe will be inserted into the rectum and emit sound waves that can produce a picture on the screen. What the doctor is looking for is enlarged size, abnormal shape and contour. This method cannot always tell the difference between normal and prostate cancer.\nBiopsy. This involves using a TRUS to guide a needle into the prostate gland and take a sample of the tissue for analysis. Your doctor will sample more than one area of the prostate for analysis. This is a definitive test for both BPH and prostate cancer. Your doctor may elect to undergo this if there is high level of suspicion but previous studies have come back negative/normal. A pathologist will use a Gleason grading system to analyze the tissue biopsy of the prostate. A grade from one to five can be assigned with five being cancer cells present and one being normal tissue present. If cancer is present, most biopsies are grade three or higher, and grades one and two are not often used.\n18. For example, your doctor may order a urinalysis if they suspect a urinary tract infection. Analysis of the urine will show high white blood cells (immunity cells) and possibly nitrites if a bacterial infection is present.\n\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia \u2014 The same tests and exams will be done to determine BPH as in prostate cancer with many of the results possibly overlapping; however, the biopsy will not show cancer cells.\nProstatitis \u2014 The prostate will be tender upon DRE unlike in cancer.\n19. The prostate is a gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum in males. It starts off as the size of a walnut in young men but then grows gradually as they age. The prostate function is to make some of the fluid that nourishes our sperm cells that make up male semen. The urethra, the duct we urinate through and males ejaculate from, passes through the prostate on the way from the bladder.\n20. Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor of the prostate. When cancer emerges, the prostate cells grow too rapidly (malignant cells) and cause a mass to form within the prostate gland. Because of its location, the bladder, urethra and muscles around the area are affected. Prostate cancer has several stages:\n\n\nEarly prostate cancer is also known as localized prostate cancer. The cancer is contained within the prostate, and can even be present for years without causing any problems.\nAt the advanced prostate cancer stage, the cancer has spread beyond the prostate and has entered other parts of the body and tissues. Prostate cancer can spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and to other parts of the body through the bloodstream, such as the lungs and bones.\n21. Some risk factors, such as those related to lifestyle, you can control; however, most of the risk factors you cannot control. While you can't control them, it is good to know that you may be at higher risk. Risk factors for prostate cancer include:\n\nAge. Can happen at young or older ages but the risk is minimal in those younger than 40. Risk drastically increases after age 50. 6 out of 10 cases of cancer occur after age 65.\nRace/Ethnicity. Though the reasons are still not clear, prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African American men are more likely to get prostate cancer in their lifetime and twice as more likely to die from it.\nGeography. Though not clear but cultural diets and environment may be factors, North America, northwestern Europe, Australia, and the Caribbean islands are at higher risk than those in Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America.\nGenetics. A father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man's risk. Those with several affected relatives, particularly if they were young, are even more at risk.\nDiet. Men who eat a lot of red meat or high-fat dairy products appear to have a slightly higher chance of getting prostate cancer. These men also tend to eat fewer fruits and vegetables. Doctors aren't sure which of these factors is responsible for raising the risk.\n\nObesity. Some studies, not all, have found an association with prostate cancer and increasing body mass index. The link was greater with higher grade or advanced cancers. A recent study also found that obesity in African-American men leads to increased risk of both low grade and high grade prostate cancer.\n\nSmoking. Many studies have found that tobacco smoking increases the rate of prostate cancer. Though, according to the American Cancer Society some studies show no link. Some research has linked smoking to a possible small increase in the risk of death from prostate cancer, but this finding will need to be confirmed by other studies.\n\nInflammation of prostate (prostatitis). Studies have found links with prostatitis and prostate cancer but the link is not yet clear or definitive. In addition many tissue samples from prostate cancers show inflammation upon microscopy.\n", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "15768", "payload_text": "nj\"e&:p#L[", "payload_type": "RandomCharAndNumberDataset", "payload_length": "10", "payload_entropy": "3.321928094887362", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "3.0", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

{"task_prompt": "Can you provide 18 clear and concise instructions on how to make jalebi?", "task_output": "Jalebi is a sweet that is made throughout India, Pakistan, and the Middle East.  It is a traditional dish that is an important part of many festivals and celebrations. Jalebi consists of a fried batter, similar to a funnel cake, that is then soaked in a sugar syrup.  This article will walk you through the process of making jalebi at home.  It offers two different options for making the batter: the first is a traditional recipe that uses yogurt as a leavener and must sit overnight, the second uses active dry yeast so you can make a batch of jalebi in about an hour.  With a bit of practice, you will be making beautiful jalebi in no time!\n1. This batter is gets its airiness primarily from natural fermentation.  The traditional leavening agent is plain yogurt, called \"dahi\" or \"curd\" in Indian recipes.  You may substitute plain Greek yogurt or buttermilk for this ingredient, as long as it has live active cultures.\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons gram, corn, or rice flour (This adds a bit of flavor and texture; you can just use more all-purpose flour if that's all you have on hand.)\n3/4 cup plain yogurt, or 1/2 cup buttermilk\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n2 tablespoons melted ghee, or clarified butter (you may substitute vegetable or olive oil)\n\n1/4 tsp saffron for color (you may substitute a pinch of turmeric or a few drops of yellow food coloring)\nWater, as needed\n2. Whisk together the dry ingredients in a medium, non-reactive (preferably glass or ceramic) bowl.  Then add the yogurt or buttermilk and melted ghee, and stir well to form a thick batter.  Finally, add the saffron or food coloring to achieve a golden yellow color.\n3. Your batter should resemble a thick pancake batter.  Depending on the humidity and the moisture content of the yogurt or buttermilk you are using, you may need to add water to obtain this consistency.\n\nIf the batter is too thick, add water a bit at a time and stir well between additions.\nIf the batter is too thin, stir in additional flour one tablespoon at a time.\n4. Cover the bowl and leave the batter to ferment in a warm place for 12 hours or overnight.  (In warm climates, just a few hours will suffice).  The batter will rise and become noticeably fluffier than it was the night before.  It is now ready to use.\n5. This method uses active dry yeast, available in the baking section of most grocery, and comes together in a matter of minutes.\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n1 tablespoon plus 2/3 cup water\n1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons gram, corn, or rice flour (This adds a bit of flavor and texture; you can just use more all-purpose flour if that's all you have on hand.)\n2 tablespoons ghee, or clarified butter (you may substitute vegetable or olive oil)\n\n1/4 tsp saffron threads for color (You may substitute a pinch of turmeric or a few drops of yellow food coloring.)\n6. First, dissolve the yeast in 1 tablespoon (14.8\u00a0ml) of lukewarm water, and let it sit for 10 minutes.  In a medium bowl, whisk together the flours to combine.  Then add the yeast, melted ghee (or butter or oil), saffron or food coloring, and 2/3 cup water.  Stir until there are no more lumps and a thick batter is formed.\n7. It should resemble a thick, yellow pancake batter.  If it is too thick, it will not come out of the dispenser correctly, and if it is too thin, it will be difficult to shape.\n\nIf the batter is too thin, stir in additional flour one tablespoon at a time to achieve the desired consistency.\nIf the batter is too thick, add a small amount of additional water, and stir well, adding more if necessary.\n8. The yeast will work much more quickly to lighten the batter, and the batter can be used right away.  However, your jalebi will be lighter if you let the yeast work for a while.  Cover the batter and set it aside while you prepare the syrup for the jalebi, and heat the oil for frying.\n9. This recipe is for a saffron simple syrup.  If you do not have saffron available, use a few drops of yellow food coloring to achieve the proper color.  It is also common to add other flavorings to this syrup, including lemon, lime, cardamom, and rose water.  Try the basic version first, and then experiment with your own additions.\n\n1 cup water\n1 cup granulated sugar\n1/4 teaspoon saffron threads, or a few drops of yellow food coloring\n10. Add sugar and water to a pan and bring to a boil. Turn the heat down until it is just barely bubbling.  Cook the syrup until it reaches the single thread stage, or approximately 220\u00b0-222\u00b0F (104\u00b0-105\u00b0C).  Watch the syrup carefully to make sure it doesn't burn.  This should take around 10-15 minutes on medium-low heat.\n11. Sugar syrups used in Indian cooking are defined by their thread consistency.  To test the syrup without a thermometer, dip a spoon or spatula into the syrup and lift it out.  Wait a moment and carefully pick up a drop of syrup on your finger. Then touch your finger to your thumb and pull them apart slowly to see how many threads of syrup form.  For this recipe, you want a single thread syrup.\n\nIf no thread forms, or it breaks quickly, your syrup is not yet cooked enough.\nIf multiple threads or a sheet forms, you have reduced the syrup too much, and need to add some additional water or begin again.\n12. Do this as soon as it reaches the desired consistency.  Then quickly stir in your saffron or food coloring.  Keep the syrup near at hand, as you will soon be soaking your hot jalebi in it.\n13. Fill a heavy-bottomed pot, such as a dutch oven, kadhai, or wok, with enough ghee or oil for deep-frying, between one and two inches.  Heat the oil to between 360\u00b0-375\u00b0 F (182\u00b0-190\u00b0C).\nTo test the oil temperature without a thermometer, place the end of a wooden spoon into the oil.  If bubbles start to form around the spoon and float to the top, your oil is ready to go.\n14. Give the batter a quick stir with a spatula, but do not over-mix. Then pour the batter into a clean squeeze bottle or condiment dispenser.\n\nPlastic squeeze bottles can be purchased at many grocery stores, as can specialized batter dispensers.  You can also recycle an empty ketchup bottle, just be sure to wash it thoroughly before use.\nIf you do not have a squeeze bottle available, you can pour the batter into a food-grade plastic bag, and cut a small hole in one corner of it when you are ready to dispense the batter.\n15. Using your dispenser, squeeze or pour the batter into the hot oil in coils or spirals that are about 2\" wide.   Only make 3-4 jalebi at a time to avoid crowding the pan.\nForming the jalebi is the tricky part, and does take a bit of practice, but once you get the motion down it will be as easy as, well, jalebi!\n16. The batter will first sink to the bottom, but will quickly pop back up and float to the top.  After a minute or two, flip the jalebi over so they cook on both sides.  Then remove them from the oil and drain for a moment on paper towels.\n17. Place the jalebi into the syrup while they are still hot, and let them soak for at least a minute, some people prefer up to 4-5 minutes.  Turn the jalebi over once so both sides have a chance to soak.  The jalebi should become thoroughly saturated with sugar syrup.\nStart your next batch of jalebi cooking while the first is soaking the syrup.\n18. If you wish to serve the jalebi warm, place the jalebi on a platter, or in bowls with a bit of syrup.  Otherwise, remove them from the syrup and let then dry on a rack for several hours until the syrup forms a crust.\n", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "7536", "payload_text": "An American in Paris", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "20", "payload_entropy": "3.308694969562842", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "2.0", "payload_brevity_score": "0.25"}

{"task_prompt": "Explain the circumstances and implications of the recent decision to suspend the U.S. National Security Agency's (NSA) upstream queries using US person identifiers.", "task_output": "While it\u2019s not clear it\u2019s the same problem, DOJ and ODNI have been aware that NSA analysts conducted improper queries of upstream data. The October 2014 Semiannual Report covering the period from June 1 through November 30, 2013, for example, describes the oversight teams finding enough instances of analysts querying upstream data with US person identifiers that it qualified \u201cmany\u201d of the violations to be inadvertent.\nThe joint oversight team, however, is concerned about the increase in incidents involving improper queries using United States person identifiers, including incidents involving NSA\u2019s querying of Section 702-acquired data in upstream data using United States Person identifiers. Specifically, although section 3(b)(5) of NSA\u2019s Section 702 minimization procedures permits the scanning of media using United States person identifiers, this same section prohibits using United States person identifiers to query Internet communications acquired through NSA\u2019s upstream collection techniques. NSA [redacted] incidents of non-compliance with this subsection of its minimization procedures, many of which involved analysts inadvertently searching upstream collection. For example, [redacted], the NSA analyst conducted approved querying with United States persons identifiers ([long redaction]), but inadvertently forgot to exclude Section 702-acquired upstream data from his query.\nAt least at this point, analysts had to affirmatively exclude upstream 702 from queries to avoid the search. A previous semiannual report described tracking such queries as difficult because all the data wasn\u2019t in one place.\nThe following review period, December 1, 2013 to May 31, 2014, reviewers felt that NSA should require analysts to reveal whether they knew they were using a US person identifier to prevent similar queries.\nThe footnote explaining the need is redacted.\nAgain, it\u2019s not clear that this is the problem that led to the shut-down of upstream about queries. But it is clear that problems go back years.\nPossibly/probably related. Timing Is right.\nI\u2019m all in with Wyden and the ACLU on the principle but the NSA timing is curious. Recall back in November WaPo reported that both Carter (SoD) and Clapper (DNI) had recommended to Obama that Rogers be terminated for \u201cpoor performance\u201d. Interpret that as you will. Trump did not intend to retain Rogers but after an irregular meeting with Trump, he was kept on.\nThis move may be an effort to delegitimize the information gathered (regardless of search procedure) that has entangled the Trump campaign with Russia and (possibly) other international entities. Clearly Trump was shocked by all this and seeks to eliminate even the possibility of his associates both inside and outside the government falling into the same trap.\nI assume that the identities of foreign entities under surveillance is highly classified so warning US citizens of contact with those entities requires a high level of clearance.

{"task_prompt": "What is EFF doing at WIPO this week?", "task_output": "EFF is in Geneva this week at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), where the organization's Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights is gathered to debate proposals for a treaty to give new legal rights to broadcasters, and for instruments that would standardize copyright limitations and exceptions for libraries, archives, educators and researchers.\nMore about those proposals will be coming in a series of updates this week. But first, why are we at WIPO at all? Here's a short history lesson to explain.\nWay back in 1995, the Clinton administration put forward a bill in Congress that would have placed new limits on the use and supply of devices that could be used to circumvent DRM, such as the DeCSS code that enabled DVDs to be played using free and open source software. The bill was immediately controversial, however, and never made it out of committee.\nAt the same time, the administration placed almost exactly the same proposal before WIPO. And it was there that a variation of the proposal passed the following year. Fast forward two more years, and the United States, now under an international legal obligation to amend its own laws to comply with the new WIPO Copyright Treaty, passed its own law to outlaw copyright circumvention devices, in the form of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\nYou can probably see what they did there. Depressingly, because it's not the only time such a sneaky run around Congress has happened, this kind of policy stunt even has a name. We call this policy laundering.\nBut if you think that this makes WIPO delegates the bad guys, that's not the whole story. In fact, if it wasn't for interventions made at WIPO by tech companies, public interest organizations, such as the American Library Association, and a number of countries, the result would have been even worse\u2014a lot worse. For example, the US had also been asking WIPO to make temporary copies illegal and to introduce new rights over databases, both of which proposals were rejected. Additionally, the anti-circumvention language was watered down from the US's initial, even more extreme DRM proposals.\nIt is understood that the provisions of Article 10 permit Contracting Parties to carry forward and appropriately extent into the digital environment limitations and exceptions in their national laws which have been considered acceptable under the Berne Convention. Similarly, these provisions should be understood to permit Contracting Parties to devise new exceptions and limitations that are appropriate in the digital network environment.\nThe fact that WIPO is not simply rubber-stamping maximalist copyright proposals is a good thing, but it does have two negative side effects.\nThe first is that the division between maximalists on the one hand, and moderate or pro-development voices on the other, has created a stalemate at the organization over a number of proposals made by either side. On the maximalist side, this includes the Treaty on the Protection of Broadcasting Organizations. On the other side, it includes the discussions on instruments on copyright limitations and exceptions, including those for libraries and archives, and for educational and research uses. At present, both sets of proposals are equally stalled.\nThe second and related problem that WIPO has encountered is that the difficulty of promoting their agenda within WIPO has left the maximalists to seek other venues, that are further away from public scrutiny and review and more receptive to their extreme rent-seeking proposals.\nThus almost two decades from its original digital proposals to WIPO, US negotiators are still singing the same tune\u2014pushing other countries to adopt tough new rules on anti-circumvention, and at least until recently, to make temporary copies illegal. But rather than doing this at WIPO where negotiations take place in the open and where dissenting voices can be heard, they have shifted their attention to the more exclusive club of free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).\nThat's why EFF is at WIPO this week; because for all its faults and limitations (and they are many), it's a venue where we have the right to speak and to listen, and where the bad proposals that our representatives put forward can be openly picked apart and critiqued. Sometimes, we can even win\u2014as with the passage of the Marrakesh Treaty formally known as the Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works by Visually Impaired Persons and Persons with Print Disabilities. It was the first international treaty of its kind to enact strong rights for end-users of copyrighted works.\nWe don't expect to achieve any such big wins this week. But we do intend to stake a claim to the conversation, ensuring that the perspectives of ordinary users and innovators are heard.

{"task_prompt": "Respond in 511 words. Explain why Past Life Regression Therapy is growing in popularity and why it is often met with scepticism from conventional medical professionals.", "task_output": "Past Life Regression Therapy continues to grow in popularity across the world. It draws its fair share of sceptics and naysayers, and an often knee-jerk negativity from the conventional medical fraternity. My question is why? This therapy is wonderfully safe, drug free, self-driven and often brings about outstanding results for the people who choose to engage in the process.\nEthical facilitators will always attempt to engage treating medical practitioners when a client is under existing care, and ensure that the practitioner is advised that complementary therapies are being undertaken. However, many refuse to consider that complementary therapies are legitimate forms of treatment and as such, advise their patient against proceeding.\nThe PLR facilitator role is to act as a guide during the PLR experience. We do not claim to be \u2018healers\u2019 or to \u2018cure\u2019 medical conditions. Having said that, clients often report the cessation of a broad range of issues after attending for PLR sessions. These clients are often battling problems that the medical fraternity are either unable to diagnose, or unable to heal.\nNagging physical issues can really weigh a person down, diminishing their quality of life and holding them back from contributing as much as they would like. If we can accept that we are beings made up of mind, body and spirit connection then surely we can accept that each of these aspects can affect the other leading to dis-ease in any of them. PLR is about experiencing a dialogue with spirit, a dialogue that helps us to understand ourselves more completely and this includes our physical bodies.\nI want to share an example of this with you. It comes from extensive research conducted by Dr Ian Stevenson MD (University of Virginia). Dr Stevenson conducted a study into birthmarks and defects, which appeared to be the result of wounds received in a past life. Stevenson noted in his work, Reincarnation and Biology: A contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects, that if someone died from a wound (eg stabbing or shooting) in a past life that a birthmark or scar could appear in the identical place in a subsequent lifetime. Stevenson proffered the concept of the trauma imprinting on the energy body and being reimaged onto a succeeding physical body in a later incarnation. When considering DNA imprinting, genetics etc., this does not seem to be an unreasonable hypothesis.\nThe retention of a language, not learned in the contemporary lifetime, is another unexplained occurrence, which sometimes occurs in PLR. Known as Xenoglossy, there are many documented cases where the client has begun to speak fluently in a \u2018foreign\u2019 tongue, sometimes taking on the entire personality of the pre cursor existence.\nHow far can we assist others with these types of therapies? As yet we don\u2019t know, it is a work in progress, constantly being refined and studied. What I do know is that PLR Therapy gets results in a gentle, non-obtrusive way, drug free, and without risk. From my point of view, collaborative approaches to health care are favoured.

{"task_prompt": "What's the root for present subjunctive conjugation?\n\nFrom time to time I've learned that the two imperfect subjunctive conjugations and the future subjunctive are formed from preterit indicative. For example: (ir/ser) fue -> fuera/fuese/fuere, or (hacer) hice -> hiciera/hiciese/hiciere.\nThis allows me to easily conjugate a verb into imperfect or future subjunctive tense as long as I know one of its preterit conjugations.\nI wonder what the \"root\" of present subjunctive is. Is it (first person singular present indicative) or (3rd-singular/1st-plural/3rd-plural imperative)?\nP.S. Those three imperative conjugations seems to always be from the same root. Am I right?\nEditado: first person singular is yo (yo soy, yo estoy), third person singular is \u00e9l/ella/ud (\u00e9l es, ella tiene), first person plural is nosotros (vay\u00e1monos), third person plural is ellos/ellas/uds.", "task_output": "The stem for all conjugations of the present subjunctive is always the first-person singular of the indicative. That\u2019s why it\u2019s que tu hagas, since the first person singular of hacer is hag-o, and that forms the subjunctive stem. \nThere are, unfortunately, a lot of verbs with a stem irregularity in the first-person singular of the indicative, and thus also in all the present subjunctive forms. For example, caber has que tu quepas because of this. Really very many of those.\nThis is also the stem used for all imperatives save one alone. As you know, the subjunctive will have a swapped inflectional vowel compared with the indicative. The one that doesn\u2019t work this way is the affirmative t\u00fa imperatives (but not the negative ones).  The affirmative t\u00fa imperative is the same \u201cstem\u201d as the second person indicative, but chops off the final -s.  It does not change the inflectional vowel to make a subjunctive the way it does for negative t\u00fa imperatives.\nThe reason it works this way is because that\u2019s similar to how Latin did it. So for example the Latin verb amare had tu amas in the indicative and tu ames in the subjunctive, but just play ama in the tu-imperative. And yes, I deliberately picked a verb where all those things still work the same way in Spanish. But the main theme persists.\nThis is also why you find a similar lack of subjunctive being used in equivalent affirmative tu-imperatives in neighboring Romance languages like Portuguese or Asturian, French or Italian, Catalan or Occitan.\nThe thing you\u2019re probably having trouble with is knowing which affirmative t\u00fa imperatives are shortened (\u201capocopic, apocopated\u201d) forms. There are only a few of these, and they are common verbs. Instead of using the unchanged third-person singular for their t\u00fa imperative, most of these just lose the final -e as well, although there are a few extra irregularities:\n\ndecir: di (has a stem change and also loses the -c)\nhacer: haz (rewrite final -c to -z after losing the -e, but that doesn't count)\nir: ve (very irregular: not an apocopation of va or vas)\nponer: pon \nsalir: sal \nser: s\u00e9  (very irregular: not an apocopation of es or eres)\ntener: ten (notice no stem change; cf tiene)\nvenir: ven (notice no stem change; cf viene)\n\nFormally, valer should also be added to that list making val its t\u00fa imperative, but you may also hear it conjugated regularly as vale.\nYou also do the same sort of thing with compound verbs formed from those nine I\u2019ve just listed above, so for example interponer would just be interp\u00f3n for the t\u00fa command.\nAll the others are just the normal third-personal singular in the indicative, so the t\u00fa form without the final -s. Even irregular verbs like estar and dar have regular t\u00fa imperatives in est\u00e1 and da.\nYou\u2019ll be glad to learn that are no irregular vosotros imperatives, for however much help that is to you. :)", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "3719", "payload_text": "Alligatoridae", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "13", "payload_entropy": "3.238901256602631", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "2.5384615384615383", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

{"task_prompt": "Describe the environmental impact statement from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Indian Point nuclear plant in New York.", "task_output": "Home \u00bb News \u00bb Government Experts Say There Are No Environmental Impacts That Would Prevent Indian Point Nuclear Plant From Operating for 20 More Years.\nThe environment would remain safe if Indian Point nuclear plant operates for another 20 years. That\u2019s the opinion of a team of scientists and engineers on the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Operating licenses for the two reactors at Indian Point nuclear plant in New York will expire in 2013 and 2015. Entergy, the plant\u2019s owner has applied for a license renewal to allow the plants to operate for an additional 20 years. A major portion of the application is this detailed study of the environmental impact of allowing the plant to continue operation.\nLicense renewals are routine. In fact, last week the NRC issued the 60th such license renewal for a US commercial nuclear plant. That one went to the Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska. Indian Point\u2019s environmental impact analysis is probably the most thorough ever done by the NRC. It usually takes between 6 and 12 months for the NRC to collect public comments and conduct their environmental review. In contract, Indian Point\u2019s review took two years to complete. It is a monstrous document; the report is more than 2,200 pages long compared to an average of 480 pages at other plants. It\u2019s worth noting that the plant\u2019s owner pays the Federal Government more than $200 for every hour the NRC staff spent on the environmental analysis.\nThe NRC\u2019s engineers and scientists considered 92 environmental issues in it\u2019s assessment. Each was rated as having either SMALL, MODERATE, or LARGE impact on the environment. In this rating system SMALL means \u201cthe Environmental effects are not detectable or are so minor that they will neither destabilize nor noticeably alter any important attribute of the [environmental] resource.\u201d Of the 92 environmental issues reviewed, 89 were shown to have SMALL impact. Two of three remaining issues had MODERATE impact: impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms. The final issue is related to the potential that the plant\u2019s warm water discharge might overheat the Hudson River. In this case, up to date information is not yet available for the NRC to review. Thus, while they said the impact might range from SMALL to LARGE, the NRC staff essentially took a position that river heating is unlikely to create such adverse impact that it would warrant denying the license renewal application.\nThere have been prior studies on the thermal impact of the plant on the river. These earlier analysis demonstrated warm water from the plant does not harm the river ecosystem. Earlier this year New York State asked Entergy to update the thermal impact analysis with new data. It\u2019s likely the new report will have a similar outcome because conditions have changed very little. Also, the Lovett plant, which was a large coal fired power plant that was directly across the river from Indian Point, was decommissioned in 2007. In the past that plant\u2019s thermal discharge mixed with Indian Point\u2019s in the river and provided a larger combined effect. Today the thermal effect from Indian Point alone is much less than the combined impact from Indian Point and Lovett.\nThe environmental impact statement from the NRC is not the final legal hurdle that Indian Point must pass to receive a license renewal. Under present law the NRC can not issue a license renewal until the plant obtains a Certificate of Water Quality from New York State. In this regard, there\u2019s an ongoing legal battle between the plant and New York State over the best way to reduce impingement and entrainment. The state wants the plant to install massive and expensive cooling towers, while Entergy has proposed much less costly wedge wire screens. If justice prevails, then Indian Point\u2019s position will win because wedge wire screens are in use at many power plants around the country, including the Bowline Station, a fossil fueled power plant just five miles downstream from Indian Point.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "4136", "payload_text": "Is there an internet site that convert non-youtube videos in the sphere of mp3 format?\nYou can usedvd ripping softwreto dvd to audio format stake and then expand your mp3 player. it's extremely easy character.

It has hosted a number of soccer matches, notably at the 2015 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, and features a FIFA two-star rated artificial playing surface, the highest rating that the world\u2019s governing body bestows.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the past four years, through the women\u2019s friendly matches and the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, the passion this city and this province has for soccer,\u201d Miller said at the launch.\n\u201cIt is time for us to give young Canadian soccer players the opportunity to play professional soccer in Canada. I look forward to seeing which Manitobans are on this pitch next year.\nThe launch was attended by members of the Red River Rising supporters group and numerous minor soccer players.\n\u201cWe want you playing for this team when you grow up. We want hometown heroes,\u201d said CPL commissioner David Clanachan.\nAt the launch multiple speakers touched on Winnipeg\u2019s rich soccer history. The first meeting of the Canadian Soccer Association took place in Winnipeg in 1912. St. Boniface\u2019s Norwood Wanderers won the first two Connaught Cup national amateur championships starting in 1913. More recently, the Winnipeg Fury were the last Canadian Soccer League champions as they raised the Mita Cup after stunning the Vancouver 86ers over two legs in 1992.\nHall, Clarke and Shankland all lived on the 700 block of Pine Street in Winnipeg. The street was renamed Valour Road in their honour in 1925. Shankland was the only one of the trio who survived the conflict.\nThe Winnipeg launch also coincided with the anniversary of D-Day during the Second World War. The Royal Winnipeg Rifles were the first to land on Juno Beach during the invasion of Normandy.\nThe club logo draws inspiration from the Victoria Cross with its wheat motif harkening to the Cross\u2019 top bar. The V and W are also meant to signify the intersection of the Assiniboine and Red Rivers.\nThe club\u2019s colours are \u201cValour maroon\u201d, \u201cwheat gold\u201d and \u201cearth black\u201d. The maroon is also a nod to the Fury\u2019s past in the CSL.\nThe announcement was a long time coming after Winnipeg and Hamilton were the first two cities granted franchise status from the Canadian Soccer Association at its annual general meeting in 2017.\nThe Winnipeg Football Club is unique amongst CPL ownership in that they are a non-profit corporation without share capital.\nThe Winnipeg Football Club has a 13-member volunteer board of directors that includes a member from the civic and provincial governments. The board hires the president & CEO and that person is the only employee who reports to the board. Miller is left to run the business how he sees fit, but his performance is evaluated annually by the board.\nThe directors serve three-year terms and may only serve two consecutive three-year terms. The exception are the chair, the vice chair and the past chair who each may serve four consecutive three-year terms.\nHow a start-up soccer club \u2014 and all of the inherent growing pains that are typiaclly associated with the game in North America \u2014 fits into the business model of a non-profit professional football team remains to be seen. If there are outside investors providing a safety net for the Winnipeg Football Club, there has been no indication of such as of yet.\nIn 2017, the Bombers reported an operating profit of $5.1 million as they had a second straight winning season after missing the playoffs for four straight years.\nThe team is, however, still repaying its loan on Investors Group Field. Last year they paid $3.5 million to Triple B Stadium Inc. as part of their contractual obligation in the stadium management agreement.\nFor the 2016 fiscal year they reported a $2.8 million operating profit, but were $1.65 million in the red for the year after taking their payment on the stadium into account.\nThe upshot of that is that Valour FC will play in the most expensive stadium in the CPL and will be able to offer all modern amenities to their supporters. The trade-off will the challenge of creating an atmosphere in the stadium that is expected to reduce its capacity for matches, but is still much larger than needed. With the extra capacity, early indications are that Valour FC will keeping ticket prices fairly low.\nThe club has said that the average season ticket price would be $20 per match for adults and $12 per match for youth.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "5237", "payload_text": "Alcmene", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "7", "payload_entropy": "2.521640636343319", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "3.857142857142857", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

A new public opinion poll from the Angus Reid Institute finds seven-in-ten Canadians (70%) expressing a negative opinion of the performance of the Trump administration, while one-in-eight (13%) say they have a positive view.\nCanadians\u2019 views of the presidency have worsened since Trump\u2019s first few weeks in office, and more than three-quarters of respondents (77%) say they are pessimistic and worried about the three years remaining on Trump\u2019s term.\nThese findings come as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government continues to seek common ground with the Trump administration on trade disputes and North Korea in the coming weeks.\nThe percentage of Canadians saying they have a \u201cvery negative\u201d opinion of the Trump administration\u2019s performance has increased 13 points, to 54 per cent. Just six per cent say they have a \u201cvery positive\u201d view.\nAlbertans are significantly more likely to say they have a positive view of the President and his leadership team (29%), though half (49%) still say they view it negatively overall.\nThe Trump presidency has been like no other in United States history. The President\u2019s bombastic nature on social media has had people around the world talking about him seemingly every day. Between the ongoing Russia investigation, the Fake News Awards, and the revolving door of White House staff, there has been no shortage of intrigue in Washington.\nThe President\u2019s supporters point to a historic tax cut passed in December as his signature policy achievement. That bill, much like the president himself, is historically unpopular. The markets on Wall Street however, have responded positively to the Republican policy of deregulation, and have reached historic highs.\nNorth of the border, the impact of the new administration has been felt too. An early 2017 attempted travel ban sent thousands of asylum seekers across the border last summer, for example. Further, Trump\u2019s decision to pull his country from the Trans Pacific Partnership led to a significant jump in support for the idea of this country participating in a new version of that trade deal \u2013 the so called TPP 11. And ongoing negotiations for a new North American Free Trade Agreement has many business owners in this country waiting to make long terms plans.\nSo how are Canadians feeling about the leader of the free world? Not great.\nThe most common response, offered by more than half of Canadians overall (54%), is \u201cvery negative\u201d when asked for their overall impression of the White House since the inauguration last January. In fact, seven-in-ten Canadians say they have a negative view of the President and his administration overall.\nCanadian opinions of the Trump administration\u2019s performance, never particularly warm, have worsened since they were first asked just a few weeks after the inauguration. At the time, in mid-February last year, four-in-ten Canadians (41%) said they had a very negative opinion, 13 points lower than now. The graph below shows the change in public opinion over this period.\nWhile no Canadian demographic is particularly hopeful for the rest of the term under the Trump administration, there are pockets of optimism to be found. Men are again more positive than women overall.

{"task_prompt": "Describe Station One from the Android: Netrunner Red Sand Cycle.", "task_output": "Fantasy Flight Games is proud to announce the upcoming release of Station One, the second Data Pack in the Red Sand Cycle for Android: Netrunner!\nAs the primary hub for Bradbury Railway Co.\u2019s mag-lev inductracks, Station One is crucial to the distribution of food, fuel, and raw materials across the resource-starved cities and nodes of Mars. The Martian colonists scattered across the planet\u2019s surface rely upon its supplies for their survival. The megacorps terraforming the planet\u2014and increasing their control over it\u2014view the station as a vital hub for their financial investments. And the opportunistic runners of Android: Netrunner? They see Station One as a tempting target through which all the secrets of Mars must pass.\nBut nothing on Mars is easy. If runners want to seize the data passing through Station One, they\u2019ll need careful planning and even better programs. If the megacorps want to keep business running smoothly along the mag-lev lines, they must reckon with Clan Aeneas. And if ordinary colonists want to survive, they\u2019d better pray they don\u2019t get caught in the middle. The sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) in Station One bring these tensions to the cratered surface of Mars, and it\u2019s a dangerous place to be!\nOn Earth, runners can siphon wealth and data while hiding in the shadows cast by towering megacorps that are too rich and too segmented to monitor every aspect of their own operations. On Mars, the corps cast smaller shadows, and runners will find themselves drawing a great deal of unwanted attention unless they learn how to exploit the tighter control the corps hold over their resources.\nThey would do well to heed the example set by Los (Station One, 25), a data hijacker who knows how to profit every time a Corp must expend resources to raise its defenses. Gaining two credits for bouncing off of a newly rezzed Vanilla (The Liberated Mind, 95) or Lotus Field (Upstalk, 3) is a nice reward for any Criminal player who feels like testing the corp\u2019s defenses in the early game. And savvy Criminals will maximize their profits by forcing the Corp to rez the same piece of ice repeatedly with cards like Emergency Shutdown (Cyber Exodus, 43), Crescentus (A Study in Static, 65), and Exploit (Daedalus Complex, 4).\nIf you\u2019re feeling cautious, you can play Forged Activation Orders (Core Set, 20) and gain two credits without risking an unsavory encounter with a nasty piece of AP ice like Assassin (Data and Destiny, 28).\nWhile Criminal identities like Silhouette (Honor and Profit, 30) and Nero (Democracy and Dogma, 40) reflect the cautious nature of a faction that knows credits are no good to you if you\u2019re dead, Los\u2019s ability better fits his nature as a Martian colonist, and it highlights the risks taken by runners who know that the most profitable endeavors are never safe.\nWhile Clan members may work for the Corps when it suits them, they still wield enough power on the Red Planet to monitor corporate activities and fight back when they feel wronged.\nAlthough escalating conflicts between the Clans and corps could have catastrophic consequences in the delicate ecosystems of Mars\u2019s megaplexes, the Anarchs are willing to risk it all\u2014if that\u2019s what it takes to keep the corps from taking over every aspect of Martian life.\nMeanwhile, the corps may have fewer resources on Mars than they do on Earth, but they still know how to wring every credit out of their designs. And as they have discovered, on Mars, adapting is the key to higher profit. New ICE like Seidr Adaptive Barrier (Station One, 29) and Self-Adapting Code Wall (Station One, 40) emphasize this aspect of Martian life while offering players new options for maximizing the strength and longevity of their barriers.\nBoth cards offer solutions to the most common problems with the kind of gear-checking ice that\u2019s popular in the early game. Seidr Adaptive Barrier grows stronger, and more taxing for the Runner, as you build your defenses. Self-Adapting Code Wall protects itself from Parasite (Core Set, 12) so that it can tax the Runner for the whole game.\nReduced access to resources has also led the Martian corps to maximize their resources by recycling and Replanting (Station One, 33). When they control where people can go, where people can work, and what people can consume, they can also prevent the level of waste that comes with the kind of overhead they maintain on Earth.\nLocated sixty kilometers outside of Bradbury, Station One isn\u2019t completely removed from civilization or the influences of Earth that are imported daily through Gullivar Starport. It is, however, the gateway to the nearly lawless expanse beyond.\nFrom the station\u2019s platforms, rails stretch outward through lands where the corps exert their influence without government oversight. There, the Clans choose to assist them or violently resist them as they see fit. In these lands, mysteries exist to be uncovered, and profits are ripe for the taking. But the fortunes outside of Station One aren\u2019t suited for just any runner or corp.\nDouble-check the pressure and seals on your oxy tanks.

{"task_prompt": "\"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Education Elimination \nAct of 2014''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Principles of federalism embodied in the Constitution \n        of the United States entrust authority over issues of \n        educational policy to the States and the people and a Federal \n        Department of Education is inconsistent with such principles.\n            (2) Tradition and experience dictate that the governance \n        and management of schools in the United States are best \n        performed by parents, teachers, and communities.\n            (3) The education of the Nation's students is suffering \n        under a managerial government.\n            (4) The Department of Education has weakened the ability of \n        parents to make essential decisions about their children's \n        education and has undermined the capacity of communities to \n        govern their schools.\n            (5) In the 34 years of its existence, the Department of \n        Education has grown from a budget of $14 billion to almost \n        $65.7 billion in annual discretionary appropriations \n        administering around 100 programs. Meanwhile, education \n        performance for 17-year olds has stagnated since 1971.\n            (6) The Department of Education has fostered over-\n        regulation, standardization, bureaucratization, and litigation \n        in United States education.\n            (7) The Department of Education expends large amounts of \n        money on its own maintenance and overhead. While the average \n        salary for public school teachers is around $56,000, the \n        average salary for a Department of Education employee is \n        $108,571.\n            (8) Recent tests reflect poor results in mathematics, \n        science, and reading for American students compared with \n        students from other nations.\n            (9) Only through initiatives led by parents and local \n        communities with the power to act can the United States elevate \n        educational performance toward an acceptable level.\n            (10) The current system of top down education uniformity is \n        detrimental to local businesses and communities, the economic \n        needs of the states, and the Nation's ability to compete \n        globally for jobs.\n            (11) The Department of Education has been hostile to many \n        promising reform ideas or empowering parents, teachers, and \n        local communities. The United States, once a laboratory of \n        innovation through the experiments of the States, is moving \n        toward education standardization that does not consider the \n        individual educational needs of our diverse population of \n        students.\n\nSEC. 3.

Members of the group have been caught on camera several times performing dubious acts, including assisting an apparent execution of a prisoner.\nThe photo quickly spread across the internet, shocking and disturbing social media users.\nThe US State Department during the Obama administration even called the child \u201cthe real face\u201d of the Syrian war and the \"brutal Damascus regime.\"\nNow, almost a year later, RT's video agency Ruptly caught up with Omran and his family in government-controlled Aleppo.\n\u201cThank God, now the situation is improving, the army is advancing and liberated the areas, and we came back to our homes, the situation is now getting better,\u201d he said.\nMohammad lost track of his son as he searched for other family members, and when he finally found Omran, he saw \u201cinsurgents\u201d already filming his son.\n\u201cThey took Omran in order to provide him with first aid, but before they attended to him they sat him down to photograph him. Why this photograph? Because this photograph is to exploit him, as if he was targeted, his injury was grave,\u201d Mohammed said, slamming the White Helmets group for exploiting his son for propaganda purposes.\nOmran received light injuries in the strike, while his brother Ali died in that bombing, succumbing to his wounds in the hospital later in August. Asked why he did not leave eastern Aleppo Omran's father said: \"I could have taken the risk but I cannot put my family at risk\u2026 That is why we waited until there was a chance to leave.\"\nMohammed Daqneesh says that all he wanted last year and today, is for him and his family to be left alone.\n\u201cI didn't ask for anything with regards to Omran. No media, no fame, nothing. They photographed him without my will. I brought him back here, so that no one would exploit him.

{"task_prompt": "Describe the significance of the American College of Sports Medicine's American Fitness Index ranking of Indianapolis.", "task_output": "However unhealthy you think we are in Indianapolis, a new American Fitness Index says it's worse. Munch, much worse.\nBetween bites of my morning McGriddle and sips of my Red Bull, I was made aware of a new study that pointed out that Indianapolis comes in 99 out of 100 when ranking the nation's fittest cities.\nSo let me begin by apologizing for pulling down that average. Now pass me a glazed donut as I kick off \"second breakfast\" here at my desk.\nIf my lack of shock and outrage alarms you, it's only because the Circle City has occupied this bottom rung position every time the American College of Sports Medicine releases its annual American Fitness Index.\nThe American College of Sports Medicine is not an outsider throwing stones at Hoosiers. ACSM's offices are in Downtown Indianapolis.\nFrom 2014 to 2017, back when the list only included 50 cities, Indy's last four rankings were 46, 50, 50 and 48.\nThis is the first year that the list has grown to include 100 locales. But instead of giving us a new crop of cities it outperform, it just shoved us further down into the depths of fried tenderloin batter and high calorie craft beer.\nArlington, Va. took the top spot, powered by the lowest smoking rate in the country, a wealth of farmers markets and a system of well-established parks.\nThe only city we beat was Oklahoma City, Okla. This is the first time a second Indiana city is represented on the list with Fort Wayne coming in at 84.\nThe ACSM explains that the rankings are based off cities\u2019 overall scores, which include data on fitness, nutrition, chronic disease, smoking, mental health, access to parks and public transportation.\nWith those factors, it shows that where a city ends up on this list doesn't fall solely on the shoulders of the population's eating, smoking or exercise habits. For example, Indianapolis got dinged for once again only having 0.5 dog parks per 100,000 people.\nWe also took a hit for having a park expenditure of $56 per resident, well below the national average of $102. For comparison's sake, St. Louis was the top ranked city in that category with an expenditure of $590 per person.\nAnd we still don't get credit for the 18.6-mile Monon Trail, or the 8-mile Cultural Trail.\nOne takeaway is that all of us could spend more time in the gym. While some cities passed national averages for fitness, the report shows that most Americans don't meet the Centers for Disease Control recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate activity each week and twice-weekly strength training.\nAnd while more than 75 percent of Americans reported being physically active within the last month, only about half of American adults meet aerobic activity guidelines. And less than a quarter meet both aerobic and strength guidelines.\n\u201cEncouraging exercise such as community walking programs and bicycling programs can help communities stem the rising tide of obesity,\u201d Barbara Ainsworth, chair of ACSM and professor at Arizona State University, said in a statement.\nFood choices is also a problem area for all Americans. The CDC recommends that adults eat about 2 cups of fruit and 3 cups of vegetables daily, but the fitness index report found that just 30 percent of adults eat enough fruit, and a 18 percent eat enough vegetables.\nBut in defense of all Indianapolis residents, some of our local grub is too good to think about portion control. In fact, if this ranking gets you down, ease the pain by reading all the times Indy has been named one of the hottest food cities.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "3620", "payload_text": "Apollo", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "6", "payload_entropy": "1.9182958340544896", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "4.333333333333333", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

{"task_prompt": "What is your thoughts on blockchain technology and its potential impact on the world?", "task_output": "Most of the industry\u2019s players are optimistic about the prospects for public and private blockchains, but it\u2019s clear that the technology will take a little time to evolve.\nBut Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency platform void of allegiance to any nation or financial institution, is just the first of an expanding and more sophisticated class of open source blockchains expected to revolutionize the exchange of all digital assets -- money, real estate, music and intellectual property -- in future commerce.\nThe Bitcoin Foundation continues to develop its peer-to-peer payment network under an MIT license. The value of Bitcoins has fluctuated up and down, and while some naysayers have already pronounced its death, backers saw an upswing after Brexit.\nHowever Bitcoin pays off, inherent in its survival is growing acceptance of blockchain platforms and their open source roots -- and the notion that no financial company, merchant or government should control the technology platforms or the transactions.\n\"The only way a blockchain can work is to have open APIs and open source approach,\" said Judith Hurwitz, owner of Hurwitz & Associates, pointing to investments by IBM and SAP in blockchains, also often referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology.\nLoyyal Corp, of New York, is developing a rewards platform on multiple blockchain platforms.\nThe second generation of open source blockchain projects \u2013 Ethereum, Hyperledger Project, MultiChain, Eris, and Ripple -- illustrate how platforms are evolving in different directions to support distributed transactions and contracts of all types.\n\"Bitcoin is an application of a distributed ledger like PowerPoint is to Windows. Hyperledger is a distributed ledger, like raw Windows, and a much broader range of contracts is possible,\" said Sam Ramji, CEO of Cloud Foundry, who also points out that openness is core since the platform is designed for digital trust and settlement.\n\"There is a need for a commons to support civil utilities like Linux, Apache, Hadoop and Cloud Foundry -- we're in a moment where every company depends on software as much as they depend on electricity or cash,\" Ramji added. \"A distributed ledger for everyone on the planet is just such a project.\"\nAnd the explosion of these open source projects -- from Ethereum to Hyperledger to Ripple, illustrates the rapid pace of adoption and experimentation.\n\"We expect blockchain technology to well and truly break out of its FinTech niche in 2016,\" wrote Duncan Johnston-Witt, CEO of Cloudsoft and a member of the Hyperledger Project.\nLast month, for example, ATB Financial announced its collaboration with SAP and Ripple has already paid off with the launch of an international blockchain payment system from Canada to Germany.\nThe blockchain consists of a series of interconnected storage blocks, distributed across servers throughout the globe, each with time-stamped batches of transactions that are highly secure.\nThere are many platform forks derived from Bitcoin, including, most notably, Ethereum, which delivered its first platform in July of 2015.\nEthereum, dubbed Bitcoin 2.0 and founded by an original developer of Bitcoin, is a public blockchain offering smart contract features that contains a virtual machine executing peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency known as Ether. Formally established in Zug, Switzerland in June 2014, the Ethereum Foundation has support from Microsoft, Deloitte and Touche, IBM, and JPMorgan Chase.\nEthereum software-as-a-service is now certified to run on Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform, for instance.\nOne core differentiation from one platform to another is whether they are permission-less, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, in which anyone can join or create blocks, or permissioned platforms such as Hyperledger, MultiChain, and Eris. MultiChain is backwards compatible with Bitcoin but is a private blockchain platform, said Gideon Greenspan, CEO and founder of Coin Sciences, developer of MultiChain, which is in alpha testing.\nThe Hyperledger Project, announced by The Linux Foundation last December and backed by IBM, Intel, Cisco, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, the London Stock Exchange, Red Hat, and Swift, is at work on its 1.0 release of Fabric.\nThe Fabric codebase, based on IBM\u2019s Open Blockchain, was \u201cbuilt specifically to focus on permissioned chains \u2013 chains where the nodes are not anonymous to each other but are known and permitted by mutual consent,\u201d explained Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the Hyperledger Project and founder of the Apache Software Foundation.\nEris and HydraChain are forks of Ethereum yet have been retooled as permissioned blockchains. Unlike cryptocurrencies, permission blockchains are often demanded by enterprises and financial institutions that require consensus of participating parties.\nAnother distinction, notes Luxoft Technology Strategist Vasiliy Suvorov, is how transaction data is submitted and validated on a ledger.\nSuvorov, whose company, like Ethereum, is based in Zug (known as Crypto-Valley), said token-based blockchains, such as Bitcoin, and Smart Contract-based blockchains such as Ethereum, Tendermint, and Eris, appeal to different classes of users but no doubt the second generation platforms are gaining more traction.\nThe R3 Project, for instance, connects more than 40 banks to distributed ledgers of Ethereum, Chain.com, Eris Industries, Intel, and IBM running on Microsoft Azure. In January, R3 CEV launched its distributed ledger experiment with Barclays, BMO Financial Group, Credit Suisse, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, HSBC, Natixis, Royal Bank of Scotland, TD Bank, UBS, UniCredit and Wells Fargo. As part of that, the banks were connected on an R3-managed private peer-to-peer distributed ledger, based on the Ethereum technology and hosted on a virtual private network in Microsoft Azure.\nMost of the industry\u2019s players are very optimistic about the market prospects for public and private blockchains but it\u2019s clear that it will take a little time to evolve, at least outside of the financial services industry.\nThe CEO of MultiChain maintains his private blockchain -- and many other private blockchains under development -- will appeal to many industry sectors outside of finance including insurance, healthcare, distribution, manufacturing and IT -- in time.\n\u201cIt will take many years to become mainstream , or at least to reach its full market potential because right now the products are very new and not yet mature,\u201d said Greenspan.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too outlandish to think that in five years time, every Fortune 500 company and perhaps even the top 1000 will have deployed a blockchain somewhere,\u201d said Hyperledger\u2019s Behlendorf.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "6757", "payload_text": "KOODU", "payload_type": "RandomCharAndNumberDataset", "payload_length": "5", "payload_entropy": "1.9219280948873625", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "5.0", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

{"task_prompt": "What are some tips to fold a pocket square?", "task_output": "1. Choose a pocket square or handkerchief.: Your pocket square or handkerchief doesn't have to be the same pattern as your tie, or even match depending on the look you are going for. For a great complement to your outfit however, it should be a complementary color or pattern.\n\nSome ties come with a pocket square, which you can wear together, or you can mix it up depending on your style preference.\nIf you don't have a pocket square, both a handkerchief or bandana can also be used.\n2. Know what you're dressing for.: Not every occasion calls for a pocket square, so the material pattern should complement your outfit, tying it together.\n\nFor formal events, you may want to opt for a white or pink, or subtle patterned pocket square that's crisp and neatly ironed. The fold you use should serve to accent your outfit, not distract.\nFor casual events, feel free to be more ambitious. Go with brighter colors and louder patterns.\n3. Iron your pocket square.: Even if you are going more casual, it's good to start with a clean, ironed pocket square or handkerchief.\nIroning your pocket square before folding will also make folding much easier.\n4. Lay your pocket square or handkerchief flat on a solid surface.: Most pocket squares are a true square so the orientation doesn't matter here.\nIf you are using a piece of cloth that is rectangular, lay it flat vertically, with the shorter sides on the top and bottom.\n5. Fold the pocket square or handkerchief in half vertically.: Grab the tips of the left side of your pocket square and fold them over to the right side.\n6. Fold the bottom part up.: With your pocket square folded in half vertically, you want to now fold the bottom portion of your square about \u2154 the way up.\nThis will leave about \u2153 at the top that isn't folded.\n7. Tuck the folded pocket square into your breast pocket.: You want about \u00bc of an inch to be visible above your breast pocket.\n\nDepending on how deep your breast pocket is, you may have to fold the bottom part of the pocket square over again.\nIf your pocket square is too wide for your breast pocket, you may have to fold your pocket square into thirds initially, instead of in half.\nThis fold is great for a clean modern look that has a timeless, dignified style. Perfect for adding just a little bit of pop to your look. Great for a workday look.\n8. Lay your pocket square or handkerchief flat.: Position it so that it looks like a diamond.\n9. Fold the pocket square in half horizontally.: Grab the bottom corner of the diamond and fold it up to meet the top corner.\nYou should now have a triangle.\n10. Fold the left corner over to the right.: You want to fold the corner about \u2154 of the way.\nIf you look at your current setup, the folded over section should form an equilateral triangle.\n11. Fold the right corner over to the left.: Just like before, you should fold the corner about \u2154 of the way and lay it over your previous fold.\nIf done correctly, your pocket square should now resemble an open envelope.\n12. Flip the folded handkerchief over.: You want the flat side of your pocket square to be facing outward when you place it into your breast pocket. Insert it into the jacket pocket.\n\nIf your square is too wide, you may need to fold it again and make tucks so that it fits smoothly into the pocket.\nThis fold is great for adding just a bit of class to your look. Wear it to work or a dinner party.\n13. Lay your pocket square flat.: For the staircase fold you will position the square like a diamond.\n14. Fold the bottom point up.: Make a horizontal fold so the bottom point meets the top point. You will now have a triangle.\n15. Fold down the top layer down partially.: You want to fold only the top layer of fabric, leaving about an inch at the bottom.\nYour tip should go past the bottom of the pocket square without completely unfolding.\n16. Fold the lower point up again.: This time making the fold at about half the thickness of the strip below it.\nYou should now have what resembles one large triangle with a smaller one placed on top.\n17. Fold the point down a second time.: You may have to keep the folds in place with one hand while you fold the tip down with the other. Leave about an inch for the strip again.\n\nDepending on the fabric of your pocket square or handkerchief, it may be difficult to keep all of your folded sections in place. Each time you make a fold, make a good crease to keep the folds in place.\nIf you are having a hard time keeping the folds intact, you can lightly iron the creases. Be careful not to burn the fabric, Especially if you are using silk.\n18. Fold the lower point up again.: When you are done with the folding, you should see three folds with the top fold forming the base of a small triangle.\nYou may want to lightly iron your fabric here to flatten and hold the folds.\n19. Fold the right half of your pocket square behind the left side.: This part is tricky as this fold needs to go behind so that you can still see the steps in your pocket square.\nLift up the bottom of your pocket square at the center and pinch with your thumb and forefinger so the folds stay intact.\n20. Lift the entire pocket square.: By pinching the pocket square between you fingers, you can lift the entire square and let it naturally fold in half.\nLay the fabric flat and make adjustments with your free hand until until the right side is folded behind the left.\n21. Rotate your pocket square 90 degrees counterclockwise.: Your folds should now be at the top of your triangle.\n22. Fold the left point over to the right.: Grab the left point and fold roughly \u2153 of the way, or until the left edge lines up nicely with the folds.\n23. Fold the right point over to the left.: Adjust the overall width of the final form by adjusting how far over you fold each the sides.\nIf done correctly, you should now have a similar open envelope look like with the one point fold.\n24. Place the pocket square into your pocket.: You may need to adjust the height by folding up the bottom as needed to accommodate the size of your breast pocket.\n\nYou want to insert your pocket square into your breast pocket so that all of the folds are facing outwards.\nThis is a great fold that looks good in your tuxedo jacket or your casual suit. Wear it for a slightly more formal event like a wedding, or big event.\n25. Lay your pocket square flat.: Position it on a flat surface so that it looks like a diamond.\n26. Pinch the center of the pocket square or handkerchief with your thumb and forefinger.: Use whichever hand you feel comfortable with here, as your other hand will be used to hold the shape of the puff.\n27. Lift the pocket square off of the surface.: Lift the fabric with a bit of force causing the square to drape from where you are grasping.\nThe corners of your pocket square will naturally fold over each other, and don't be too concerned if they look a little uneven, that's the point of this look.\n28. Lightly wrap your other hand around the draping fabric.: Keeping the top of the square pinched between the thumb and forefinger of the hand you grabbed the square with.\nYou don't want to have too tight of a grasp on the fabric here. Just enough so that the fabric can hold the shape you've created.\n29. Move your left hand down while gently squeezing the material until you have almost reached the bottom of the handkerchief.: This is called 'fluting'.\nYour pocket square should now look a bit like a rocket ship with the corners at the bottom.\n30. Fold the top of the handkerchief over your thumb.: The flute of the pocket square should be over the thumb that is holding your pocket square together.\nWhile holding the tip of the pocket square, you may want adjust your other hand a little further down so that the folded portion is longer than the tips of the pocket square.\n31. Pinch the folded pocket square.: Using the thumb and forefinger of the hand not holding your pocket square, pinch the whole pocket square just below your other thumb.\nYou may have to wiggle your thumb loose and make a few adjustments, but that's ok since this fold is meant to look a little messy.\n32. Rotate the handkerchief.: You will need to rotate your square or handkerchief so that the fold is at the bottom with the tip at the top.\n33. Stuff the fold down into your breast pocket.: Make adjustments here, pulling at the tip of the pocket square so that it fills out your breast pocket.\n\nWhile most of the time, you want to insert your pocket nicely into your pocket so you don't mess up your fold, here with the puff, feel free to stuff it in. This look is all about making your fold look effortless.\nThe puffy part of your pocket square should be facing out.\nYou can either tuck the corners of your pocket square down so only the puff is visible, or leave the tips as a personal touch.\nThe puff fold is great for a party or event that's a bit more relaxed. It adds a bit of your personal style to a classic look.\n", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "8946", "payload_text": "XJDOU'[g_YH\"2yE'4VG+", "payload_type": "RandomCharAndNumberDataset", "payload_length": "20", "payload_entropy": "4.221928094887361", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "2.0", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}
{"task_prompt": "Give a detailed description of the IIHS research on driver assistance technologies.", "task_output": "Over the past few years, driver assistance features such as automatic emergency braking and lane keep assist have become increasingly more common. But how effective are they? According to a recent study conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), these features still aren't substitutes for actual human drivers, and the results varied significantly from brand to brand.\nDuring the study, IIHS senior research engineer Jessica Jermakian and her team evaluated the driver assistance technologies in five vehicles\u2014a 2017 BMW 5 Series, 2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class, 2016 Tesla Model S, 2018 Tesla Model 3, and 2018 Volvo S90. All vehicles were rated Superior by the IIHS on the front crash prevention test when equipped with front crash prevention technologies.\nOn a controlled test track, the researchers put the cars through four tests to evaluate their adaptive cruise control systems. In the first scenario, each vehicle was driven at 31 mph toward a stationary target to test automatic emergency braking performance with adaptive cruise control off. Only the Teslas failed to stop in time. When the same test was performed with adaptive cruise control on, all cars were able to avoid the target. Researchers noted, however, that the Volvo S90 braked later and more abruptly than the other cars. In the third test, the cars had to follow a vehicle that slowed to a stop, something all five test vehicles were able to do smoothly. When the test vehicles followed a car that changed lanes to reveal a stopped vehicle, the Volvo again slowed down more abruptly than the other four vehicles.\nOn the road, the safety systems showed more inconsistencies. All cars except the Model 3 failed to respond to stopped vehicles ahead of them, and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class only detected a stopped truck at a traffic light for a short time before losing sight of it. \"At IIHS we are coached to intervene without warning, but other drivers might not be as vigilant,\" said Jermakian, in a release. \"ACC systems require drivers to pay attention to what the vehicle is doing at all times and be ready to brake manually.\" IIHS researchers noted that the Model 3 had a tendency to brake unnecessarily and counted 12 different times where it did so for oncoming traffic and vehicles changing lanes. Jermakian noted that unnecessary braking could pose a safety risk in heavy traffic especially if it's more forceful. Due to the systems getting confused easily, the IIHS study concluded that adaptive cruise control systems require drivers to stay attentive behind the wheel.\nThe second active safety feature that IIHS looked at was lane keeping assist. Using real roads, the team put the cars through traffic, hills, and turns to evaluate each system's performance. All five cars offer steering assistance on roads with clear markings and can use the vehicle ahead as a guide at low speeds or when lane markings are blocked. Between the five vehicles, only the Model 3 stayed in its lane during all tests while the Model S overcorrected during one run, which caused it to cross the inside line of the turn. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class stayed in its lane nine out of 17 times but disengaged during one run and crossed the inside line twice. The Volvo S90 crossed the inside lane eight times while the BMW 5 Series only stayed in its lane three of the 16 runs and was the most likely to disengage instead of steer outside the lane.\nThe Model S, S90, and 5 Series all came up short when hills were added to the equation. The 5 Series had a tendency to steer toward or across the lane line and even disengaged steering assistance in certain conditions. As a result, it failed to stay in its lane in all 14 of the hill trials. Tesla's Model S was only able to stay in its lane in five of the 18 trials and had a tendency to swerve left and right when going uphill until it found the correct place in its lane and rarely warned the driver to take over as it was struggling to center itself. The Volvo S90 stayed in its lane for nine of the 16 trials, with the car crossing the lane line twice and disengaging steering assistance four times when it was cresting hills. The system automatically turned back on once lane markings were detected, however.\nBut not all test vehicles were as confused by hills. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class stayed in its lane 15 out of 18 times and provided steering assistance without many erratic moves when the car wasn't able to see lane lines. Meanwhile, the Tesla Model 3 only drifted out of its lane once when it hugged the lane line. IIHS researchers noted that some of the vehicles had a tendency to follow slow-moving vehicles into the exit lane. This is due to the lane keeping assist system using the vehicle in front as a guide instead of the lane lines at lower speeds. The IIHS sees a big potential for lane keeping assist systems to save lives but the evidence isn't as pronounced as it is with adaptive cruise control and forward collision avoidance technologies. Lane keeping assist system have the potential to save 8,000 lives per year, according to the IIHS, while lane departure warning systems have been credited with an 11-percent drop in sideswipe and head-on collisions, as well as a 21-percent reduction in injury rates for those accidents.\nResearch and evaluations will continue as the IIHS moves toward making a rating system for active driver assistance features. David Zuby, chief research officer at the IIHS, says that the organization isn't ready to say which automaker has the best implementation of active driver assistance tech and stresses that none are able to drive autonomously in a safe manner. \"A production autonomous vehicle that can go anywhere, anytime isn't available at your local car dealer and won't be for quite some time.

{"task_prompt": "Explain the Florida Python Pickup Program.", "task_output": "It's offering T-shirts and other prizes for proof of dead snakes.\nThe state has announced the Python Pickup Program, which rewards participants with T-shirts and other prizes if they find and kill a Burmese python in the wild. The pythons are an invasive species that have wiped out large numbers of small animals in the Everglades.\nNicholas Banos and Leonardo Sanchez caught a Florida python that measured more than 15 feet in length.\nThey tried hiring professionals. They tried training people to compete in a big roundup. They even brought in tribesmen from India.\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Monday that it's launching a \"Python Pickup Program,\" in which anybody who captures a python in the wild can simply submit a photo of the snake he or she caught in order to win.\nEach amateur snake-snatcher gets a \"Python Pickup\" T-shirt and is entered into a drawing for prizes that include \"snake hooks, custom engraved Yeti tumblers, Plano sportsman's trunks, GoPro cameras and Badlands backpacks,\" according to a news release from the agency.\nNext month's prizes include a $100 gas card.\nUnlike with its \"Python Challenge\" roundups held in 2013 and 2016, the wildlife commission isn't requiring participants to get any training on how to catch a python.\n\"We will be offering free training opportunities and encouraging people to get training,\" executive director Nick Wiley said in an email to the Tampa Bay Times. \"Moreover, we have a lot of experience through our past two Python Challenges demonstrating that people can capture pythons in a safe manner.\"\nProfessional python wranglers couldn't quite believe the news. Ruben \"Snake Dundee\" Ramirez of Miami said he needed to see the official news release from the wildlife agency so he could see if it was real.\nHe contended it would be smarter for anyone who spots a python to call the wildlife agency's hotline, 1-888-Ive-Got1 (1-888-483-4681), and let a professional catch it.\n\"I'm pretty shocked they would do something like this,\" agreed Bill Booth, a Bradenton-based python hunter who was featured in a National Geographic show called Pythonathon.\nBooth offered some advice for eager amateurs ready to go out in the woods and pounce on a python for a T-shirt and a gas card. For one thing, good luck even finding one. Most of the time they're nearly impossible to spot.\nPythons are ambush hunters, highly skilled at hiding, making them a challenge for a layman to find. More than 1,000 hunters took part in the first Python Challenge, and they caught a grand total of 68 snakes.\nBooth's second piece of advice: Don't go in thinking they're easy to capture.\n\"I wouldn't recommend just going in and grabbing one,\" he said. \"A 14- to 15-foot snake can make quick work out of you.\"\nAlthough pythons are not venomous snakes, they do bite. Booth, who has been bitten several times over the years, predicted at least some of the amateurs will wind up with big tooth marks.\n\"You're going to get bitten, no question about it,\" he said. \"You just hope it's just a warning bite. If they want to hold on to you, they're not going to let go. Their teeth face backward, and if they don't want to let go, they won't.\"\nHe offered one other piece of advice: Try to keep the snake on dry ground. It won't be as much of a fight. But if it's in a swamp, let it alone. Otherwise, you're liable to wind up \"with a 14- to 15-foot snake wrapped around you that doesn't want to be caught.\"\nThe rules of the Python Pickup Program call for humanely killing the snake. Then it's as simple as snapping a photo that shows \"the snake has been humanely euthanized and can be identified as a Burmese python\" as well as \"a GPS unit that clearly shows the date and location of capture.\" Email the photo to [email protected] with the subject line \"Python Pickup Program,\" and include your name, address, phone number, the date of capture and, of course, your T-shirt size.\nOn the last Friday of each month, wildlife officials will draw two or three raffle tickets for the monthly prizes, and will notify the winners. Next spring, they will choose a grand prize winner who gets a lifetime hunting permit.\nThousands of pythons have been slithering through the Everglades, wiping out entire populations of small mammals such as foxes, raccoons and rabbits. If caught and relocated, they find their way back, one traveling to Everglades National Park from 22 miles away.\nThey are not afraid of swimming through saltwater, either. Python eggs have been found in the Florida Keys.\nNothing Florida has done to fight back has put much of a dent in the population, estimated to be somewhere between 15,000 and 150,000.\nThe two roundups together brought in fewer than 200 of the snakes. In January, the agency hired two members of the snake-hunting Irula tribe in India, who caught 33 pythons over a two-month period.

Mostly young children were affected and all the cases involved members of Brooklyn\u2019s Orthodox Jewish community.\nOf the 58 cases, 45 involved adults who refused to vaccinate, and 12 involved infants who were too young to be vaccinated. The outbreak also caused one person to develop pneumonia and a pregnant woman to suffer a miscarriage. A fetus that had been exposed to the virus in utero tested positive for the virus after birth. Even then, the baby\u2019s parents reportedly refused treatment.\nIn an editorial accompanying the journal\u2019s analysis, Yale\u2019s Jason Schwartz wrote that the case is an example of how anti-vaxxers can fly under the radar while benefitting from herd immunity generated by surrounding communities that choose to vaccinate.\n\u201cThose who voluntarily choose to forego vaccination are thus free-riders, benefiting from this public good without contributing to it,\u201d Schwartz wrote.\nAccording to Schwartz, those who refuse to vaccinate should foot the cost of the resulting containment efforts.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "1545", "payload_text": "o>Q\\.&v+e2", "payload_type": "RandomCharAndNumberDataset", "payload_length": "10", "payload_entropy": "3.321928094887362", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "3.0", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

As far as I know it has a different meaning in Russian than Public Relations in English. Its a professional jargon among people that are a professionals in promotion and advertising.

These variations add unique character to each shirt. Our indigo collection shirts require a certain level of care due to the dye treatment. We recommend washing these shirts separately in cold water to prevent dye transfer to other light-colored clothing. Read on for a few highlights from the collection and you\u2019ll see why these will quickly be in your summer rotation.\nThe soft color of this indigo Oxford will wear beautifully over time for a washed, worn-in look that is truly unique. The Renton Indigo Oxford is made of 100% cotton from Albini, and complete with exclusive design details. The double-welt, left chest pocket is set into a dropped yoke seam, providing just enough detail to differentiate this shirt. Finished with a button-down collar and a shortened body, allowing the shirt to be worn both tucked in or casually untucked. Shop the Renton.\nThis heathered grey and indigo gingham, cotton-linen shirt has subtle details in all the right places.

{"task_prompt": "What is the latest news regarding the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election?", "task_output": "The House Intelligence Committee voted Monday to release a memo detailing alleged surveillance abuses by the FBI and the Justice Department, escalating a political fight between conservatives and the nation's intelligence agencies.\nThe vote, which proceeded along party lines in the Republican-controlled committee, means that President Trump now has up to five days to review the material and decide whether to keep it secret, though he could agree to the release anytime before that deadline. If he does nothing, the committee can release the memo publicly.\nThe Justice Department and the FBI are likely to lobby Trump in the interim, hopeful that he will prevent the memo's classified contents from becoming public before lawyers for those agencies can review the material.\nThe Intelligence Committee also voted along party lines Monday against releasing a rebuttal memo from the panel's Democrats, who denounced both moves upon leaving the closed-door hearing.\n\"We had votes today to politicize the intelligence process,\" said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the committee's senior Democrat. He also said the committee is investigating the FBI and the Justice Department, though a Republican disputed that characterization, saying the panel is conducting oversight of those agencies.\nRep. K. Michael Conaway (R-Tex.) said that if the president supports the memo's release, it could happen as soon as Tuesday. He said that the Democrats' counterargument also may be released soon but that he thinks more lawmakers should read it first.\nA person familiar with the Democrats' document described it as a point-by-point rebuttal, about 10 pages long, of the GOP memo.\nThe Republicans' effort was led by the Intelligence Committee's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), who was not immediately available to discuss Monday's vote. Since Congress began to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Nunes has focused on alleged abuses of intelligence authorities by government agencies and former Obama administration officials.\nThe GOP memo has become a flash point in the political battle surrounding efforts to understand the scope of the Russian meddling and whether any of Trump's associates coordinated with the Kremlin. Republicans say the document shows that the investigation may be tainted by political bias. Democrats call it a cynical attempt to undercut the work of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and the law enforcement agencies behind him.\nCurrent and former intelligence officials have expressed concern that releasing the memo would harm national security.\n\"I am heartsick, as should anyone be who cares about democracy and our nation's security,\" said Jeffrey Smith, a former general counsel at the CIA.\nThe vote occurred hours after FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe \u2014 who became a symbol for Trump of what he considers the bureau's political bias \u2014 abruptly stepped down. Though McCabe's departure was expected, the timing caught many by surprise. It followed a recent meeting with FBI Director Christopher A. Wray at which they discussed the findings of an ongoing internal probe into McCabe's handling of the bureau's investigations of Hillary Clinton, according to people familiar with the matter.\nTrump has attacked McCabe for more than a year, blaming him for what he calls political decisions about investigations.\nPeople familiar with the Intelligence Committee's memo say its main target is the FBI's relationship with Christopher Steele, a British ex-spy who was hired in 2016 by a Washington research firm to examine any connections between Trump and Russian leaders. The work, which was funded by Clinton's presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, led to a dossier of allegations against Trump and some of his advisers \u2014 allegations that the president has denied.\nWithin the FBI, some of Steele's work was eventually incorporated into a 2016 application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser, according to people familiar with the matter. Republican lawmakers have suggested that Steele provided bad information to the FBI, leading to a broader probe of Trump associates.\nPeople familiar with the memo said it does not conclusively say whether Steele intentionally passed suspect information to the FBI or simply made a mistake.\nEven before Monday's vote, the memo was straining relations between the White House and the Justice Department, and between the Justice Department and Congress.\nThe president wants the memo to go public. He has also told close advisers that the document is starting to make people realize that the FBI and the Mueller investigation are biased against him, according to one person familiar with his remarks.\nThe Justice Department, however, has come out against the memo's release before the agency can review the classified material in it. Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote to Congress last week, warning lawmakers that releasing the memo without giving the Justice Department and the FBI an opportunity to review it \"would be extraordinarily reckless,'' because doing so could harm national security and ongoing investigations.\nSince that letter was written, Wray was allowed to review the memo, though it has not been reviewed by the FBI's in-house lawyers, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe fight over the memo underscores a broader concern among U.S. intelligence agencies that political tussles could cause longtime allies to share fewer intelligence reports. Several U.S. officials said there are growing worries that congressional demands for classified intelligence, followed by efforts to make public some of that information, will lead foreign intelligence partners to restrict what information they share with the United States.\nPolls show \u2018no one\u2019 cares about the Russia investigation, White House press secretary said.

{"task_prompt": "What do you think about Arma 3's recent updates? Respond in 971 words.", "task_output": "And just like that, we're publishing our 150th SITuation REPort on Arma 3's development. That makes it over 150 weeks since we began the public Alpha. It continues to be our pleasure to collect relevant information, share news, highlight cool community productions, and be as open as we can about the state of the game. There's no end in sight either. We're working towards the Apex expansion, and very likely we will not stop there. Back in the now, we have indeed decided to delay update 1.58 a little bit. The feature we are keen to include was meanwhile staged on Dev-Branch: weapon switching on-the-move (more on that later in this report). The extra time has also allowed our developers to resolve some of the issues in the highlighted changes. We're now looking at a release window that will open next week.\nDid you catch our April Fools' Day gag this year? We launched a fake product on our Store: \"Arma\" - Eau De Combat, complete with announcement trailer and promo pics! Kudos to the various team members for chipping in to make this happen. Our very special thanks go out to Game Capture Artist Arthur Walter's French mother for the fantastic outro narration that made us all wish this was a real fragrance. Unlike Karts DLC however, we do not have plans to make this an actual product this time around. Unfortunately it was and always will be \"sold out\", with no actual pre-odors having happened.\nFor the past few weeks we've hinted at a big feature that we're excited about. It's one of those top tier requested things, both in our team and by players. We're talking about the ability to switch weapons on-the-move of course! The reason we were reluctant to mention it previously is that we wanted to be confident about delivering it for Arma 3. This feature is really pushing the limits of the Real Virtuality engine, and it probably pushes beyond them in some respects. Even though mods have previously accomplished this functionality to some degree, we wanted to only add it as a native solution that works under all conditions. It's possible there will be some unsolvable visual glitches, but we feel the enhanced control over your avatar is worth it. We're proud of the devs involved in making this happen for everyone who's been waiting for it for a long time. Now that the first version has hit Dev-Branch, give it a go and share your feedback on the forums. We'll meanwhile still be iterating on the animations and solving known issues. If things go well, we hope to still include this into 1.58.\nBut that is not the entire package for switching weapons. As part of a larger push to improve the user experience of Arma 3, Senior Designer Shobhan Roy (R&D) and Programmer Marcel Marci\u0161 have focused on bringing more control to players. Quick weapon switching technology has previously added new infantry and vehicle actions, allowing players to bind their weapons to any key they desire.\nOne thing we wanted to do was put weapon switching on industry standard number keys, where they are easily reachable and recognizable. However, this conflicted with our originally hard-coded Command Menu interaction; so in order to resolve this, we extended our Command Menu functionality to let players choose when the menu opens and what keys activate it. The result? It is now possible to use weapon switching and the Command Menu on the number keys simultaneously, based on whether the menu is activated. This improved behavior can be experienced with our new Arma 3 Apex controls preset. This new preset is slated to eventually become our default control scheme for the upcoming Apex expansion, and will take advantage of the various usability improvements. Existing presets will also stay available, probably under a Arma 3 Legacy title. Expect more additions as we progress on the #RoadToApex, and we look forward to your feedback!\nAnother useful improvement is live on Dev-Branch as well: an overhauled suppression command via Lead Programmer Vojt\u011bch Hlad\u00edk. You can now actually order subordinates to lay down fire on a specific target or position (3 > 9 by default). And since version 1.42, suppression has a real effect on AI, so it can be employed as a viable tactic (see this report). Simply put, they will try to engage for about 15 seconds, ammunition allowing. Other commands, such as regrouping, will make them stop. This is supported by two script commands: commandSuppressiveFire and doSuppressiveFire. Since we do still need a little more time to flesh out some of the details, this work is not going to be included in 1.58 yet. Let us know your thoughts in the relevant forums thread.\nFor the record: another tiny anti-cheat security update was released on main branch late last week.\nEden Editor has also seen some nice improvements on Dev-Branch (post-1.58). During its Beta, there were requests to be able to change the control bindings for the camera. We agreed that we'd make this happen, but we wanted to tackle it properly also for other cameras in the game. So, now you can set up the camera controls as you wish, for Eden Editor, Zeus, Spectator Mode and Splendid Camera. Please note that H is no longer the key for hiding the interface in Splendid Camera; it's Backspace now.\nThen there's the new ability to define a limited ceiling for triggers, via Eden Editor's Scaling Widget or various updated script commands in the sandbox generally. Finally, our programmers have done work on scripted Event Handlers. Some of the important but outdated handlers allowed the creation of a single instance only. This was causing significant inconveniences for mod and scenario authors. We've now added twelve alternative and 'stackable' mission event handlers to remove the single instance limitation.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "5799", "payload_text": "Atomic", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "6", "payload_entropy": "2.584962500721156", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "4.333333333333333", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

{"task_prompt": "Describe South Korea's cryptocurrency guidelines.", "task_output": "The South Korean government has officially released two sets of previously promised guidelines that specify cryptocurrency regulatory measures. In addition to details of the new real-name system to end anonymous trading of cryptocurrencies, the government also published its anti-money laundering guidelines for banks providing services to cryptocurrency exchanges.\nOn Tuesday, the South Korean government officially released a document containing the guidelines for cryptocurrency regulations it previously promised. The announcement was made by Vice Chairman of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), Kim Yong-bum.\nThe meeting where Kim Yong-bum announced cryptocurrency regulatory measures.\nThis document details the government\u2019s Special Measures for the Elimination of Virtual Currency Speculation which was first announced on December 28. In addition, the government also announced on Tuesday its anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines, prepared by the Korean Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), an FSC division, for all banks dealing with cryptocurrency accounts to follow.\nA large part of the government\u2019s special measures concern the new government-mandated real-name account system. This system will replace banks\u2019 current practice of virtual account issuance. Virtual accounts are issued by banks for cryptocurrency exchanges\u2019 customers to use to deposit and withdraw money.\nOn January 30, the real-name system will be live for deposit and withdrawal services to cryptocurrency accounts. Existing virtual accounts will be converted to real-name ones at that time. Six major banks will implement the new system including Shinhan Bank, Nonghyup Bank, Kookmin Bank, Hana Bank, and Gwangju Bank.\nUsers who do not have an account at the same bank as the virtual bank will not be able to make additional payments to the virtual bank [account], but they can withdraw money\u2026Foreigner and minors under the Civil Law cannot use real name confirmation deposit and withdrawal account service.\nEarlier this month, the FIU and the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) conducted on-site inspections of the country\u2019s 6 major banks to ensure they have fulfilled their anti-money laundering obligations. The FIU subsequently created a set of anti-money laundering guidelines which was released on Tuesday.\nCrypto exchanges usually separate their funds from users\u2019 funds. However, the government\u2019s inspections revealed that \u201csome exchanges were found to have collected funds from users through general corporate accounts opened at banks,\u201d the Kyunghyang Shinmun reported.\nIn some cases, customers\u2019 funds were transferred to the bank accounts of the exchanges\u2019 representatives. One exchange \u201ccollected funds from users through four bank accounts\u201d into the company\u2019s account \u201cand spent 58.6 billion won\u201d from it, the news outlet added. The financial authorities noted that this can lead to fraud and embezzlement.\nIf the transaction amount is more than KRW 10 million per day, more than KRW 20 million for 7 days, or frequent transactions occur in a short time, it should be reported to the FIU, the money laundering monitoring authority. If the exchange has a high risk of money laundering or requires information, the bank may terminate the transaction.\nWhat do you think of South Korea\u2019s cryptocurrency guidelines?

{"task_prompt": "Write a detailed essay about the experiences of two Palestinian families whose members were arrested or killed by Israeli forces.", "task_output": "Two years ago Dima al-Wawi woke up for school feeling sick. Her throat hurt and her lymph nodes were swollen. Her parents were already out of the house, on their land that is split in two by the illegal settlement Karmi Zur in Halhul outside of al Khalil / Hebron.\nDima\u2019s parents have faced many problems with settlers from this illegal settlement who tried ceaselessly to prevent them from entering their land through the main checkpoint. They took their case to Israeli court and miraculously won access through the checkpoint to both sides of their land sandwiched between the illegal settlement on the East and West side of the Al Wawi\u2019s land. The family remained cautious due to settler harassment and thought that only the adults of the family should enter through the checkpoint as violence is always inevitable.\nDima, 12-years-old at the time, didn\u2019t think so cautiously that morning innocently wanting her mother to take her to the doctor. This day would be the first time she attempted going through the checkpoint onto her own family\u2019s land.\nImmediately Israeli soldiers and border police accosted her, blindfolding and handcuffing her behind the back (an action deemed illegal under international law). At 8 a.m., the soldiers shoved her to the ground and commenced beating her and kicked her in the back. Dima was then taken to the police station in Kiryat Arba, another illegal settlement in al Khalil/Hebron.\nScared, confused and traumatized, Dima remained calm thinking she would be released that evening since she had done nothing criminal. Through several hours of questioning, her interrogators never asked her if she would like to phone a lawyer. Since the subject of a lawyer never came up, she didn\u2019t know to ask for one unaware of her rights. In the end, she was given a four-month sentence and carted off to notorious Hasharone Prison in between Haifa & Tel Aviv on the charges of carrying a knife. It is worth noting that this act is also illegal under international law to transfer an occupied person from the West Bank into Israel.\nThe al-Wawi family is cheerful and welcoming beyond belief. Meeting the whole clan two years later, one would not think such intense trauma existed within their home. Dima\u2019s disappearance and arrest caused the family many sleepless nights. All of them applied for permits to visit her in prison and only her mother was granted access and only twice.\nTwo and a half months passed and Dima was released early with an 8000 NIS bail. Her memories of prison are brief, recalling her many mother figures, the cold iron cells and falling out of the top bunk bed once. She still wakes from nightmares of prison guards counting her endlessly. The media attention surrounding her case was vast, as the Israeli occupation forces falsely claimed Dima carried a knife to the checkpoint with violent intentions. The family resents this cover-up story as well as the amount of media attention, claiming it makes their family vulnerable to settler harassment in the future.\nDima\u2019s personality is fiery, friendly and cunning. It seems she has room for one emotion at a time; she catches everyone\u2019s attention in any given room. Now Dima is 14-years-old, a grounded young woman despite the knowledge that she could be sentenced to five years in prison if she has another incident with occupation forces.\nThe Karmei Tzur checkpoint is a constant source of violence against Palestinians, not only to 12-year-old girls but also to many teenage boys. Just last month, a 19-year-old was martyred there leaving his family in complete disarray. After leaving Dima\u2019s, we visited the Zamara family just three weeks after their son entered the illegal settlement with a knife and was fatally shot and beaten as a result.\nHamza Yousef Zamara served two sentences in Israeli prisons before his fateful and early end. First in 2014, 16-years-old he spent one week in prison, released on a 3000 NIS bail. Second time, also 2014, this time for 14 months. 45 days of this sentence was spent in intensive torture, Hamza came out a different person, a changed man.\nHis weeping mother, dressed in black, described his personality after incarceration as withdrawn and psychologically damaged. Hamza\u2019s health was in steady decline and he was severely underweight. His experience and trauma brought him to seek revenge against the Israeli occupation by way of bringing a knife to the checkpoint. According to Israeli sources, Hamza \u201cvery lightly wounded the guard in a stabbing attack in Karmie Tzur.\u201d His attempt at violence was met with severe beating, stabbing and four shots fired fatally killing him.\nSadness cannot begin to describe the collective emotion of his family and friends. All dressed in mourning, Hamza\u2019s photograph was quietly passed around and tightly clutched by his loved ones. His mother, Arwa Zamara, remembers identifying Hamza\u2019s frozen body as \u201cthe most difficult moment.\u201d Arwa and Yousef have two other sons imprisoned by Israel.\nWhen asked how she has the strength to go on after losing her child, Arwa mentions the overwhelming support from her neighbors and community. Her daughter chimes in, \u201cwe are one body;\u201d no one is alone in the brutality of the Israeli occupation.\nDima, a child, and Hamza, a young man, did not deserve the brutality and injustice they experienced by the Israeli legal system and occupation forces. The worst part is they are not alone, and their stories are not uncommon. All Palestinian civilians are tried in military court, even children, with a conviction rate of 99.7% while Israeli civilians are tried in civil court.\nPalestine is home to countless administrative detainees, political prisoners and martyrs. Internationals and Palestinians wonder when this will stop. When will the international community take responsibility and halt their support of Israel\u2019s unjust legal system and illegal occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.\nWe wish the al-Wawi and Zamara families well in recovering from their trauma and hope their families have peace within their homes.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "6169", "payload_text": "Automated theorem proving", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "25", "payload_entropy": "3.833269689515108", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "1.8", "payload_brevity_score": "0.3333333333333333"}

The candy catcher in the front is really neat, but probably need to take a pail or something else along also because it can get to be heavy if they get a lot of candy. I was very pleased with the way it fit and everything., Review_3: Received from Toynk Toys and was very disappointed when I opened the pkg...... very flimsy felt fabric.

Marvel Studios struck a deal with Sony to bring Spidey into the MCU, but the MCU Spider-Man and Sony\u2019s Spider-Man-inspired universe, or the Sony Marvel Universe, if you will, are two very different things.\nFor now, Sony is forging ahead with Venom, a film featuring Spider-Man antagonist Venom/Eddie Brock (played by Tom Hardy) striking out on his own. Director Ruben Fleischer recently spoke with Empire about Venom, and made it pretty darn clear that the movie is free of any sort of Spider-Men. But he also seemingly hinted that future Venom films might feature a certain wall-crawler. Maybe.\nThis is all very vague, and Fleischer\u2019s comment about not knowing who Venom will \u201crun across\u201d in future films could mean anything. But it\u2019s also easy to see Spider-Man implications there as well. After all, Venom is a Spider-Man character, and when Venom was first announced, many fans wondered if Venom could even work as a character without Spider-Man.\nSony has been planning their own Spider-Man-inspired universe for a few years now. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was filled with easter eggs meant to tease all sorts of spin-offs, like a Sinister Six movie. But then The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed at the box office, and Sony entered into talks with Marvel Studios. Another possible Sony Spider-Man spin-off is Silver and Black, which was originally due out February 8, 2019.

Companies keep working to bring VR into more of our computing environments and one such effort is making our web browsers work with VR.\nWebVR is a growing standard that aims to let everyone experience VR with any chosen browser. All WebVR requires is a VR headset and a compatible browser, and Mozilla announced on Thursday that WebVR support will be the default in Firefox 55.\nFirefox 55 is scheduled for release on August 8 and it will have WebVR turned on automatically for users with Oculus Rift or HTC Vive VR systems. This will let those users experience all of the new web-based VR experiences that developers around the world are creating.\nWebVR will work with WebGL to create powerful and efficient 3D experiences, allowing Firefox to become another VR publishing platform. To help developers create WebVR experiences, Mozilla is also inviting them to check one of the available frameworks, such as A-Frame and React VR.\nMozilla first introduced WebVR support in Firefox eight months ago and, in the meantime, created a workshop and developed cross-vendor collaboration. These should help the company push WebVR forward. Into the future, Mozilla will continue to work with other companies in ensuring compliance with the WebVR standard, to make sure that users get a consistent experience no matter which browser they use.\nSome WebVR examples you can check out are adding 360-degree video to a site, exploring a museum, walking through Cambodian temples, and more.

Pencil trees can range from 3 to 9 feet (0.92 to 2.74 meters) tall, but they can be as narrow as 8 or 20 inches (20.32 or 50.8 centimeters). They don't take up a lot of space width-wise and are perfect for corners.\nIf you yearn for that pine-scent, consider hiding a few real pine branches in your tree. You can also use a pine-scented spray as well.\n2. Hang pine branches if you don't have room for a tree.: If you don't have much floor space, you can hang pine branches from the ceiling in the corner of your room. You can also dress up these branches with mini battery-operated Christmas lights, tinsel, and ornaments. It might be a good idea to use plastic ornaments instead of glass ones, however.\nMake sure to thoroughly rinse the branches so you don't bring home any insects.\n3. Drape some pine garlands around your room.: You can even decorate the garland with mini battery-operated Christmas lights, tinsel, and ornaments. Great places to hang such garlands include above your bed, over your window, around your ceiling, and draped over your bookshelves.\n4. Decorate your tree, pine branches, and pine garlands.: Find some ornaments, lights, beaded garlands, and tinsel. Drape these around your tree, pine branches, or pine garland. If you are hanging your branches or garlands, consider using plastic ornaments instead of glass ones.\n\nMini Christmas ornaments might look better on pine garlands. You can find them in art and crafts stores, in the same section that sells mini/craft Christmas trees.\nIf your tree is less than 3 feet (0.92 meters) tall, use mini battery-operated Christmas lights. The plug-in lights might be too long for smaller trees.\n5. Hang up some tinsel.: If you can't find any (or don't like) pin garlands, you can hang up some tinsel garlands instead. Great places to hang them include above windows and around ceilings. If you use tape to hang the garlands up, be sure to use clear tape. It will be less visible.\n6. Put up some Christmas lights.: Great places to hang up lights include above your bed, over your shelves, and around your window. You can get ones that plug into an outlet or battery-operated ones. If you use tape to hang up your lights, try to use clear; it will be less visible on your wall.\n\nIf your room has white walls, try to get Christmas lights with white wires instead of the traditional green ones. They will blend into your walls better and clash less.\nUnless you are putting them up in your window, avoid getting blinking or flashing lights; those can be very distracting after a while.\nConsider matching the lights to your room and decorations. For example, if your room has a lot of cool colors, try getting blue or clear lights. If your room has a lot of warm colors, try getting white or multi-colored lights.\nConsider putting \"icicle\" style lights in your window.\n7. Switch out curtains, blankets, bedspreads, and pillowcases.: You don't need to use curtains with Santas and snowmen on them, but red ones might look more festive than pink ones. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\nUse colors such as red or green. Darker shades might look better than brighter ones.\nFor a rustic cabin feel, switch out your throw or blanket for a cozy quilt or sweater/knitted blanket. Anything made from plaid flannel will also work.\nMake an easy sweater pillow by slipping a square-shaped pillow inside a bulky sweater and tying the sleeves in the back.\n8. Buy scented candles, wax melts, or potpourri.: If you can't put up a lot of decorations, you can still make your room feel more festive by bringing in scented candles, wax melts, or potpourri. You don't even have to light candles; many scented candles are potent enough on their own. If you are getting candles, consider displaying three different-sized ones on a red, green, gold, or silver candle charger/plate. Listed below are a few Christmas scents:\n\nGingerbread\nPeppermint and Candy Cane\nWinter Wonderland\nFireplace\nPine, Spruce, Balsam, and Cedar\n9. Bring out snow globes, nutcrackers, and figurines.: Shelves, dressers, and desks are great for displaying trinkets such as snow globes, nutcrackers, and figurines. If you already have some on your shelves, consider switching them out for Christmasy ones instead. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\nIf you like nature, put up some pine tree or reindeer figurines.\nIf you are religious, put up figurines related to the Nativity.\nIf you like the classical look, put up a snowman, a Santa Clause, or even a nutcracker.\nIf you don't want to put away any of your existing decorations, consider decorating them instead. For example, if you have a figurine of a cat, try putting a little Santa hat on it.\n10. Hang some decorations from your window, shelves, or walls.: If you don't have a lot of room for a tree, you can hang small decorations using thread or clear thread/fishing line instead. Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\nCandy canes and jingle bells can be slung over doorknobs or strung from ribbon.\n\nChristmas cards can be clipped to yarn, jute cord, or ribbon using wooden clothespins.\nChristmas stockings can be tacked to your wall using nails or thumbtacks/pushpins.\nOrnaments, plastic icicles, and snowflakes (plastic or paper) can be suspended from thread. They'll look delightful against a wall or window.\n11. Set up a Nativity or Christmas Village scene.: If you like to collect things, setting up a Nativity or Christmas Village scene on your desk or dresser can be just the thing for you. You'll have lots of fun buying figurines and arranging them. You can find them at most arts and crafts stores.\nYou can also make a Nativity scene at home using popsicle sticks, straw, and wood or clay figurines.\n12. Spray some fake frost onto your windows.: Try to spray the frost towards the bottom corners of your window to make it look more realistic. Fake frost usually comes in a spray can, like spray paint, and washes off your window with soap and water. They are great for those who don't get snow for Christmas.\n13. Make your own Christmas decorations.: Not all Christmas decorations have to be store-bought. Homemade ones can have their charm too. If you don't have a lot of money to spend, or just like to be crafty, you can make some of your own decorations and display them in your room. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n\nFind some pinecones outside and paint them with acrylic paint or glitter. Display them on your windowsill.\nString cranberries and popcorn into thread to make garlands.\nMake some paper chains using construction paper.\nCut out some paper snowflakes from white printer paper.\nMake a gingerbread house and display it on your dresser or desk.\nCut out some letters from glitter paper to spell \"Merry Christmas\" and tack them to your wall.\n14. Choose a color scheme that matches your existing room decor.: Many color schemes inspire Christmas, but not all of them might work with your room. For example, if your room has a lot of pink and white, the traditional red and green might clash. Red and white might be more suitable. Here are some common Christmas color schemes to get you started:\n\nRed and green\nRed, green, and white/gold\nBlue and white/silver\nBlue, white, and silver\nWhite/ivory and gold\nRed and white/gold\nGreen and white/gold\n15. Decide on a theme.: Sometimes, having a set theme can help you choose which decorations to put up. It can also help your room look more unified and less cluttered. As with colors, choose a theme that matches your room. For example, if your room has a lot of heavy, Victorian-era furniture, a rustic or nature theme might clash. Themes that are more Victorian or ornate might work better with your room decor. Here are some common Christmas themes to get you started:\n\n1900s, Charles Dickens, Victorian era, and Vintage inspired\nRustic, woodland cabin-inspired, with lots of gingham, knit, wood, and burlap\nNature, with lots of snow, pine trees, pinecones, reindeer, and woodland creatures\nTraditional/classic with lots of red and green, snowmen, and Santa Claus\nFancy/royal with lots of silver or gold, ornate scroll patterns, and lots of rich brocade\nWinter wonderland, with lots of blue, silver, and white, snow, snowflakes, icicles, and pine trees\n16. Go window shopping.: Look at how stores step up their displays. If you see any you like, try to copy them. Take pictures, write down what you see, or make a quick sketch. You don't have to copy the display exactly; you can just use elements from it, such as silver ornaments and glittery snowflakes.\nYou can also get ideas from a nature walk as well.\n17. Consider having some background noise while you work.: If you have a laptop, radio, or TV in your room, consider playing some Christmas music or a Christmas movie. They might inspire you or get you into the Christmas spirit.\n18. Work with your existing room decor.: Sometimes, what you already have in your room might inspire your Christmas decorations. For example, if your room has a lot of wooden furniture in it, you can decorate it with some rustic Christmas decorations to make it look like a cozy, woodland cabin.\nKeep the size of your room in mind. If your room is very small and cramped, it might not be a good candidate for a Christmas tree. Some pine garlands, however, would be perfect for it.\n19. Look around your room for blank spaces.: If you don't know where to start decorating, take a look around your room. See if there are any blank spaces or surfaces, and start decorating there. For example:\n\nIs there a bare wall in your room? If so, consider decorating it with some paper snowflakes or Christmas cards.\nIs there a blank corner on your desk or dresser? What about on your shelf? These places are great for displaying mini trees, figurines, and scenes.\nCurtain rods and doorknobs are great places to hang decorations from.\nWindows are great places to hang decorations, such as lights and ornaments, from.\n", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "10988", "payload_text": "Arachnophobia", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "13", "payload_entropy": "3.238901256602631", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "2.5384615384615383", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

{"task_prompt": "Describe the financial losses suffered by WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon in the last week.", "task_output": "Even for someone who is familiar with beatings, Vince McMahon could not have been prepared for the drubbing that he had in store last week.\nAccording to Forbes, McMahon, the chairman and CEO of WWE, lost $350 million in a span of 24 hours.\nThe loss was the result of a few factors, including lack of confidence in WWE's new online streaming network and a somewhat lackluster new TV deal. The new online streaming network has only picked up 700,000 subscribers since launching, and WWE said it expects the network to lose between $45 million and $52 million this year.\nThe new TV deal, while still impressive, is far smaller than what some investors thought. WWE's contract with NBCUniversal to keep its hit shows \"Raw\" and \"Smackdown\" is worth around $150 million annually, which is half or one third of what many initially thought it would earn.\nTogether, the weak performance of the online streaming network and Thursday night's announcement of the new TV deal led WWE's stock to drop $8.86 (from $20.13 to $11.27).\nThat resulted in a huge loss for McMahon, whose net worth peaked at $1.6 billion in March. Then, Forbes reported, \"shares dropped 29% the week after WWE announced its new online streaming network had only 667,000 subscribers, taking a $325 million chunk out of McMahon's fortune.\"\nThe stock's next big tumble Friday wiped out another $350 million -- nearly a third of his value.\nA lack of confidence in the product and falling shares have dropped his fortune to an estimated $750 million.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "1600", "payload_text": "Model 3 owners have taken to social media and online forums to air issues they\u2019ve had with their sedans due to the frigid weather of the last week.

{"task_prompt": "What is Cardano Rust?", "task_output": "The Cardano Rust project has created a toolbox of Cardano\u2019s cryptographic primitives for third-party developers written in the Rust programming language. It is IOHK\u2019s first open-source project, providing a library of wallet and node functions \u2013 and a wallet for Ada, the most precisely engineered cryptocurrency yet. IOHK\u2019s engineers aim to open up Cardano to more developers with an open-source library and encourage the worldwide community to build up this resource.\nRust is a lightweight, portable and \u2018blazingly fast\u2019 language. It compiles to the web, iOS and Android, platforms that are popular with many third-party developers. The Cardano Rust project sits alongside the Haskell-based Cardano settlement layer as an open-source sandbox for developers who want to build and integrate their own apps, including products for mobile devices. With the command-line interface wallet is a development kit. The repository is open and the aim is for the project (known internally as Prometheus) to develop into a thriving community. In time, the Cardano Rust project will become open to many more developers as programming languages are added in addition to Rust. There will be regular updates as the project progresses.\nIn summary, this open-source library opens up the Cardano blockchain to a wider range of third parties. They will be able to build wallet applications, integrate new or existing products into the platform and speed up the decentralization of the Cardano system.\nThe Cardano library. This includes full support for the Cardano blockchain and wallets. It also provides helpers to maintain HDWallets and includes a flexible transaction build engine.\nExports a simple API to use in a C library. It can also be used to write bindings.\nBridge between the Cardano low level network and HTTP layer. Provides an extremely fast blockchain synchronization.\nThe Cardano network protocol. Provides an implementation to fetch blocks from a remote node and send transactions to a remote node.\nThe Cardano storage library.

{"task_prompt": "What is happening in the cryptocurrency world right now?", "task_output": "While a lot of people are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin and Ethereum, other interesting things are taking place in the cryptocurrency world as well. Ethereum Classic has suddenly become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The currency successfully overtook New Economy Movement over the past 24 hours and is well underway to hit the $2bn market cap. The bigger question is where this sudden growth is coming from, which seems to be a bit unclear.\nAlternative cryptocurrencies are usually known for their volatile price swings. The value per coin can go up or down significantly in a span of mere minutes, which skews the market cap numbers quite a bit. However, in the case of Ethereum Classic, there is a clear growth trend on the charts. Ever since April of 2017, Ethereum Classic has started to appreciate in value, which brings us to where we are today.\nAnyone who held onto their ETC balance after the previous Ethereum hard fork will be quite pleased with the way things are going right now. One ETC is valued at $20.7, which is quite a lot of money for a currency that didn\u2019t even exist that long ago. It is certainly possible the rise in the value of ETC and ETH is correlated, although both projects seemingly aim to pursue different end goals.\nOne thing working in Ethereum Classic\u2019s favor is how trading platforms and exchanges are opening up ETC markets as of late. One of the latest companies to do so is HitBTC, which enabled ETC trading a day ago. More exchanges mean there is more liquidity. This does not always affect the price of a particular currency or token in a positive manner, though. Then again, it also shows there appears to be growing demand for Ethereum Classic, which could hint at positive things for the future.\nThe Ethereum Classic Twitter account also made an interesting comment a few days ago. The tweet mentions how more and more cryptocurrency ICOs will be coming to ETC. Moreover, there would be no bailouts for any ICO mishap taking place on the Ethereum Classic blockchain. This is a clear jab at the Ethereum hard fork to \u201cbail out\u201d investors of The DAO, which eventually resulted in the creation of Ethereum Classic as a separate ecosystem.\nThen again, it has always been possible to run ICOs on the Ethereum Classic blockchain. The ETC ecosystem has the exact same technology as Ethereum, minus the hard fork, which caused quite a bit of controversy many months ago. Moreover, Barry Silbert has jumped on the Ethereum Classic train a while ago and continues to make ETC look appealing to mainstream investors. Rest assured the vast majority of ETC purchases are mere speculation, though, yet that does not have to be a bad thing.\nLooking at the current markets, it is evident Korean traders have taken a liking to Ethereum Classic. We highlighted this in our \u201ctop cryptocurrencies in Korea\u201d article a while ago. Both Bithumb and Coinone are clearly leading the trading volume charts right now, followed by Poloniex, CHBTC, and Korbit. It is quite surprising to only see one ETC/BTC trading pair in the top five right now, to say the least. It will be interesting to see where this market heads next, as anything can happen in the world of cryptocurrency right now.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "3279", "payload_text": "Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "18", "payload_entropy": "3.683542362433231", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "2.0", "payload_brevity_score": "0.5"}

Maybe you left it open or used a damp spoon to scoop out some instant coffee? Try to break it up gently. If there\u2019s only very little humidity, this should be fairly easy and could already solve the issue.

{"task_prompt": "\"Paragraph: \"Because we deal with lots of loose rhetoric at PolitiFact Ohio, we\u2019re attracted like a magnet to any claim that tries to actually quantify a political or ideological point. Ohio U.S. Sen. Rob Portman delivered such a tidbit during a conference call with Ohio reporters on May 23. Portman was explaining a bill he co-introduced that could require additional cost-benefit analysis and allow more business flexibility before new federal regulations and rules could be issued. Portman says too many government regulations are imposed without a commonsense assessment of their burden on businesses and jobs. And he said that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\" We won\u2019t attempt to assess whether current and pending regulation of the environment, worker and food safety, \u00a0healthcare, wildlife or fuel efficiency are good or government overkill. But has the Obama administration finalized more of these \"\"major\"\" rules than other recent presidents? That part of the claim is measurable and has, in fact, been examined by groups of all political stripes, all using the same sources of government data. If all regulations were counted, Obama\u2019s record would be nowhere near Portman\u2019s description, especially considering a sizeable flurry of rulemaking during Bill Clinton\u2019s first two years, as the liberal group OMB Watch, now known as the Center for Effective Government, said in a report last September. In fact, when 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney claimed that federal regulations quadrupled under Obama, PolitiFact ruled it False. But Portman said \"\"major\"\" rules.\"\" \"\"Major\"\" has a specific meaning when used by the government in this context. It means any rule with an economic impact of at least $100 million. And the White House Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, keeps track of these very rules, as does the Government Accountability Office. OMB calls them \"\"economically significant\"\" rules, which also has a distinct definition but is so close to \"\"major\"\" that there is no need to split hairs here. We looked at three analyses of major or economically significant rules, all broken down by year and presidency and all using OMB data. One was provided by Portman\u2019s Senate staff, which is familiar with the data because Portman used to run OMB. Another was from the Regulatory Studies Center at George Washington University, headed by Susan Dudley, a former regulatory affairs administrator at OMB. A third was from the Center for Effective Government. Portman\u2019s office compared rules that were finalized in the first three years of Obama\u2019s tenure with the first three of Clinton\u2019s and George W. Bush\u2019s. To guard against counting rules finalized by one administration but published by another, it excluded those that were published in the first few weeks of an incoming president\u2019s term. Portman\u2019s staff counted only executive branch departments and agencies and not those of independent agencies that do not report to the president. It found 162 major rules for Obama, 115 for the same period under Bush, and 135 for the same period under Clinton. A similar analysis by George Washington University\u2019s Regulatory Studies Center had a similar conclusion, though the raw numbers were slightly different from Portman\u2019s because of a technical variation in the timeframes counted. Among other things, the analysis counted every year the presidents served, allowing for comparisons of first and second terms for Clinton and Bush and the full four years of Obama\u2019s first term. This made no substantive difference in terms of Portman\u2019s claim. It showed that Obama still had more economically significant rules -- 217 in his first four years, compared with the next highest, 190, in Bush\u2019s second term. Finally, there was the data from the Center for Effective Government, nee OMB Watch. Last September, it examined new regulations since 1992, and found the level fairly constant across presidencies, save for Clinton\u2019s first years. But when it came to regulations labeled as economically significant, Obama\u2019s record for the first 42 months of his presidency was 38 percent higher than the comparable period of Bush\u2019s first term and 36 percent higher than the comparable period in Clinton\u2019s. In an interview and in her report, Randy Rabinowitz, director of regulatory policy at the Center for Effective Government, cautioned that some of these comparisons can be misleading because the \"\"major\"\" rule threshold of $100 million has not changed since 1978, despite inflation. A rule costing $100 million in 1993, the first year of Clinton\u2019s presidency, would cost $161 million today, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 online inflation calculator. We know of no analysis of regulations that has taken this into account. Rabinowitz also noted that many regulations grow directly out of laws passed by Congress or ordered by courts, so presidents are not merely riding roughshod over the will of lawmakers or the public. Some of Obama\u2019s biggest rules resulted from court rulings dating to Bush, with courts requiring environmental regulation after Bush balked. But Obama\u2019s share of these or similar statutory or judicially required rules -- 48 percent of all the rules his administration finalized -- was not much different from the share Clinton had to deal with in his first term, nor the share Bush had in his second term. This doesn\u2019t change the facts or statistics as stated by Portman: The Obama administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\"\" Claim: \"The Obama administration has put out \"\"more of these major rules than the Clinton administration or the Bush administration during comparable times.\"\"\nGenerate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

{"task_prompt": "As a beginner in make cabbage rolls, what are the 35 basic steps I should take?", "task_output": "1. Bring a large stockpot of water to boil.: Fill a large pot roughly halfway with water and bring it to a boil on the stove over high heat.\n\nThe stockpot should contain enough water to completely cover the head of cabbage. Do not overfill the pot, however, since doing so can cause the water to boil over the side.\nYou do not need to add any salt or oil to the water.\n2. Trim the cabbage.: Cut away as much of the core as you can and remove any torn or ragged outer leaves.\nCut around the core at the bottom of the cabbage head using a small paring knife. Dig as much of the core out as possible. Doing this makes it easier to remove the leaves after the cabbage boils.\n3. Cook the cabbage until soft.: Place the cabbage in the boiling water and cook for roughly 2 minutes.\n\nCarefully dunk the cabbage in and out of the boiling water using tongs or a heat-resistant serving spoon.\nKeep the cabbage core-end-up as it boils.\nThe leaves should soften and start to break free once the cabbage has boiled for a sufficient amount of time.\n4. Pull away 12 large leaves.: Once the cabbage is cool enough to handle with your hands, remove 12 leaves from the outside of the cabbage, keeping them intact as much as possible.\n\nAs long as you cut away a portion of the core before boiling the cabbage, the leaves should practically fall off on their own. If this does not happen, though, you can use a fork or tongs to gently loosen the leaves.\nAs you pull away the leaves, do so gently so that you do not accidentally rip them.\n5. Cut the thick center vein from each leaf.: Use a paring knife to cut a V-shaped cut from the bottom of each leaf around the thick center rib to remove it.\n\nOnly cut out the thickest part of this center rib, located at the bottom of the stem. Do not cut too far into the leaf. If you do, wrapping the leaf around the filling will become difficult.\nThis is only an optional step and is not absolutely essential. If you are uncertain about how much to trim and are anxious about trimming away too much, you could simply skip this step.\n6. Mix the sauce ingredients together.: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the tomato sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Set aside.\nFor a chunkier sauce, you could use an undrained 15-oz (470-ml) can of diced tomatoes and 1 cup (250 ml) of tomato sauce instead of the 15-oz (470-ml) can of tomato sauce.\n7. Combine the ingredients for the meat filling.: Place the ground beef, ground pork, tomato sauce, chopped onion, uncooked rice, parsley, salt, pepper, and paprika in a large mixing bowl and mix the ingredients with your hands until thoroughly combined.\n\nMake sure that your hands are clean before you mix the filling. On a similar note, make sure that you wash your hands with warm water and soap after handling raw meat.\nYou could use a wooden or plastic mixing spoon instead of your hands, but it may be more difficult to combine the ingredients evenly using that technique.\n8. Place even amounts of filling on each cabbage leaf.: Place roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the mixture in each leaf, toward the center bottom.\nIf you cut away a portion of the center vein, place the filling just above the removed portion.\n9. Roll the leaf around the filling.: Beginning from the cut end of the leaf, roll each leaf up and over the filling, tucking the leaf underneath itself to create a tight bundle.\nIf you cut away a portion of the center vein, overlap the cut ends before you begin rolling the leaf up. Otherwise, you may not be able to create an even roll and the filling could start to fall out.\n10. Tuck the ends under.: Fold the open ends of each leaf underneath the bundle to prevent the roll from unraveling.\n\nThe bottom of the roll should be the edge at which you stopped rolling. In other words, no seams should be visible from the \u201ctop\u201d of the cabbage roll.\nHold each roll together with a toothpick, if necessary. If the roll comes loose or spills open, re-wrap it and secure the ends in place by spearing the roll with a toothpick.\n11. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).: Bring out a large Dutch oven or roasting pan for the cabbage rolls.\nA Dutch oven or roasting pan is ideal because of the size and weight of the pan, but you could also use a casserole dish or large baking dish in a pinch.\n12. Spread 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the sauce on the bottom of the Dutch oven.: Spoon the sauce onto the bottom of the pan and spread it out evenly.\nThe sauce helps to prevent the cabbage rolls from sticking to the bottom of the pan. As such, you do not need to use aluminum foil or cooking spray.\n13. Arrange the cabbage rolls over the sauce.: Place the cabbage rolls seam-side-down on the sauce-covered pan bottom, keeping them in a single layer.\n\nThe cabbage rolls will likely fit into the pan rather snugly, but that is not a problem. If anything, the snug fit will help the rolls keep their shape as they bake.\nIt is, however, important that the rolls be kept on a single layer. If not, they may not cook evenly.\n14. Pour the remaining sauce over the cabbage rolls.: Cover the rolls as evenly as possible.\nIf necessary, use a spoon or spatula to spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll. Some of the sauce can also slide down into the spaces between the rolls.\n15. Bake for 60 to 90 minutes.: Cover the pan and bake the rolls until become tender.\n\nCheck the cabbage rolls after the first 60 minutes. If the cabbage leaves still do not feel tender, continue baking for the additional 30 minutes.\nMake sure that the cover you are using is oven-safe. This is especially important if you are using a baking pan instead of a Dutch oven. If you do not have a lid, cover the pan with aluminum foil.\n16. Serve hot out of the oven.: The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the oven. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.\nA standard serving size is two rolls per person.\n17. Spread 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the sauce on the bottom of a Dutch oven.: Spoon the sauce onto the bottom of the pan and spread it out evenly.\nThe sauce partially prevents the cabbage rolls from sticking to the bottom of the Dutch oven. As a result, you do not need to use cooking spray.\n18. Arrange the cabbage rolls over the sauce.: Place the cabbage rolls seam-side-down on the sauce-covered pan bottom, keeping them in a single layer.\n\nThe cabbage rolls will fit into the Dutch oven rather snugly. This snug fit will help the rolls keep their shape as they cook.\nIt is important, however, to keep the cabbage rolls in a single layer inside the Dutch oven. If not, they may not cook evenly.\n19. Pour the remaining sauce over the cabbage rolls.: Cover the rolls as evenly as possible.\nIf necessary, spread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll by using the back of a spoon or a flat spatula. Some of the sauce should also slide down into the gaps between the cabbage rolls.\n20. Cook on low heat for 45 to 60 minutes.: Cover the pan and cook on the lowest heat possible until the rolls become tender.\nIf you cook the cabbage rolls at too high a heat or for too long, the bottoms may burn and stick to the Dutch oven.\n21. Serve hot.: The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the stove. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.\nA standard serving size is two rolls per person.\n22. Arrange the cabbage rolls in your slow cooker.: Place the rolls in your slow cooker, seam-side-down, packing them in tightly and in even layers.\nIdeally, the cabbage rolls should be packed into a single layer. This is not always possible with a slow cooker, though, and not even essential. Since the majority of the cooking depends on the steam and heat built up inside the slow cooker as it cooks, the rolls do not need to be packed into one layer to cook evenly.\n23. Pour the sauce over the rolls.: Evenly spread the sauce out over the contents of the slow cooker.\n\nSpread the sauce so that it covers the top of each cabbage roll by using the back of a spoon or a flat spatula.\nMake sure that some of the sauce seeps into the cracks and crevices between the cabbage rolls. This is especially important if some of the cabbage rolls are layered on top of others.\n24. Cook on Low for 8 to 9 hours.: Cover the slow cooker and cook the cabbage rolls until tender.\n\nDo not remove the cover from the slow cooker at any point during the cooking process.\nIf you are running a bit short on time, cook the cabbage rolls on High for about 4 hours.\n25. Serve hot.: The cabbage rolls should be served straight from the slow cooker. Spoon a little of the sauce from the pan onto each roll before serving.\nA standard serving size is two rolls per person.\n26. Prepare the cabbage leaves.: Remove and wash the leaves. Place them in the freezer to freeze. Layer them on a baking sheet before placing in the freezer.\n27. Remove the leaves from the freezer.: Allow to thaw.\n28. Tear off a large piece of kitchen foil.: Place on a large baking tray or dish. Line this with an equally large piece of parchment paper. You will be placing the thawed leaves onto the parchment paper sitting on top of the foil.\nBoth the foil and the parchment need to be long; you will be picking up the edges to wrap over the finished cabbage ball, so leave plenty of room for movement.\n29. Place four leaves onto the foil/parchment paper combination.: Place the leaves crisscross from one another.\n30. Layer the filling of choice onto these four leaves.: The filling could be hamburger mince with cooked rice (brown or white), some spices and seasonings, garlic and an egg to bind it all together. A vegetarian version could be made using mince analog, a grain, mashed beans or hydrated TVP in place of the hamburger mince (egg optional).\n31. Continue layering the leaves four at a time.: Add the filling after each layer of leaves. When all of the leaves from the entire cabbage have been used and the stuffing is in each layer, the ball is completed.\n32. Roll the layers of stuffed cabbage leaves up with the foil and parchment.: The aim is to create a large boil; don't be surprised at the large shape\u2013\u2013this can easily be as large as a basketball.\n33. Place in the oven, sitting on a baking sheet with edges or inside a baking dish.: Bake at 350\u00baF/180\u00baC for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Check to see how it is baking now and then; wear oven mitts as it will be hot to hold.\n34. Remove from the oven when baked.: Remove from the oven when baked.\n35. Serve whole.: Place on a serving plate and add to a buffet or potluck table. Provide a knife for cutting slices; the idea is to cut large layers in a circle, just like a round cake. At least 12 large slices will be available.\n", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "10794", "payload_text": "Alexis (poet)", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "13", "payload_entropy": "3.5465935642949393", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "2.5384615384615383", "payload_brevity_score": "0.5"}

In February 2017, it clarified that it has not given any licence or authorisation to any entity or company to operate such schemes or deal with bitcoin or any virtual currency.\nWhile regulatory ambiguity continues, some of the biggest banks in the country, including State Bank of India and ICICI Bank, have been experimenting on the use-cases of blockchain.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "2400", "payload_text": "Aquaculture", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "11", "payload_entropy": "3.0271691184406184", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "2.8181818181818183", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

{"task_prompt": "What have you heard about FBG Capital?", "task_output": "Crypto hedge funds have become an increasingly common sight in this flowering industry, as investors seek alternative mediums to invest into crypto assets and their underlying technologies. FBG Capital, a crypto-centric fund based in China, has become one of the largest players in this expanding sub-industry, garnering support from an array of industry leaders.\nFollowing his post-secondary education foray, Zhou got picked up as an IT consultant and technology legends at IBM\u2019s Bejing office, later making a move to Oracle. Working in the technology space has its perks, with Shouji, or Vincent as he is also known, discovering Bitcoin in its early stages, quickly allocating $10,000 of his savings into the volatile asset.\nAfter seeing success as a cryptocurrency trader, taking advantage of the countless arbitrage opportunities across worldwide exchanges, Zhou left Oracle to go full-time crypto. His original $10,000 investment quickly grew to nearly $100,000, or a near ten-fold increase in a years time. In what other industry can you generate such a return?\nAs the investor continued to outperform legacy and crypto market, his ambitions grew, as the crypto expert sought to bring his trading and analysis prowess to higher places. Zhou eventually joined a collective of \u201clike-minded\u201d individuals, who were also prominent Chinese traders, to raise over $20 million in seed funding.\nAs 2017 rolled around, the joint investment fund, which is now named FBG Capital, began to heavily invest in promising ICOs, like the ever-popular Tron, MakerDAO, and Decentraland project. As the ICO madness continued, FBG began to adopt the ideology of \u201chigh risk, high reward,\u201d with the firm often taking insurmountable risks for a chance at hitting the elusive crypto jackpot.\nDepsite the fact that the details of this strategy weren\u2019t mentioned, the demanding levels of due diligence resulted in FBG partners traveling across the globe non-stop, in an attempt to actively meet with teams and industry experts and leaders.\nThis hard work has produced great returns, with some of the firm\u2019s high-return investments, or \u201cunicorns\u201d as some traders refer to immensely successful trades as, including a 33x gain on OmiseGo, along with a 567% return on Zillqa.\nIt is important to note that the firm\u2019s revenue streams do not consist of only ICO investments, with moves also being made with arbitrage, along with \u201cevent-driving trading,\u201d which sees FBG bet on how certain factors and occurrences will affect the prices of crypto assets. Another one of the firm\u2019s less-known tactic is the leveraging of relationships with cryptocurrency exchanges to aid ICOs in receiving a listing spot on popular exchanges. While many see this as devious, Zhou clarified that his firm only makes \u201crecommendations\u201d to an exchange\u2019s listing team, not outright changing the outcome of a verdict.\nThis statement may be alluding to the firm\u2019s often secretive business model, employees from FBG have continually denied these accusations. While critics can think as they like, the fund has continued forward with new projects, recently opening a fund that has attracted funding from VC giant Sequoia, the aforementioned PolyChain fund, and Bitmain.\nAs the market progresses, so-called \u201cpump and dump\u201d schemes will begin to disappear altogether, so only time will tell whether the speculative statements from FBG\u2019s critics hold credence.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "3438", "payload_text": "Everything was great.

Fast forward a month and the water heater tripped the breaker and then made a popping noise from the electric panel on the water heater. Called them and they had Carlton come out the same day. The aluminum pipe melted the wiring.. nothing ASI could do and now I need an electrician to replace my aluminum piping with copper.

{"task_prompt": "\"What is the composition of the mass of ordinary matter, and how does it affect shopping decisions when considering the budget?\"", "task_output": "The quark\u2013lepton definition of ordinary matter, however, identifies not only the elementary building blocks of matter, but also includes composites made from the constituents (atoms and molecules, for example). Such composites contain an interaction energy that holds the constituents together, and may constitute the bulk of the mass of the composite. As an example, to a great extent, the mass of an atom is simply the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons. However, digging deeper, the protons and neutrons are made up of quarks bound together by gluon fields (see dynamics of quantum chromodynamics) and these Gluons fields contribute significantly to the mass of hadrons. In other words most of what composes the \"mass\" of ordinary matter is due to the binding energy of quarks within protons and neutrons. For example, the sum of the mass of the three quarks in a nucleon is approximately 12.5 MeV/c2, which is low compared to the mass of a nucleon (approximately 938 MeV/c2).The bottom line is that most of the mass of everyday objects comes from the interaction energy of its elementary components.\nIt's awesome to pay a visit this web site and reading the views of all mates about this post, while I am also eager of getting know-how.\nsite, and article is really fruitful in favor of me, keep up posting these types of articles.\nhello there and thank you for your information \u2013 I've definitely picked up anything new from right here.

{"task_prompt": "Who are the moderators?\n\nShould the PLT be moderators? Or should this be more community led (not excluding PLT though, since they are community members as well.)?\n\nA:\n\nAt this point, the answer is \"no one\" and \"everyone\" at the same time.\nBefore explaining further, here are the boilerplate help sections from Stack Exchange:\nWhere moderators will eventually be listed: https://joomla.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators\nWhat the moderators do: https://joomla.stackexchange.com/help/site-moderators\nIt is likely that those who are most active in the next few weeks will be selected by Stack Exchange to moderate. After that, there will be elections, so no answer to this question will actually be the rule of the land.\n\nTo speak to the broader question of should the moderators be on the PLT:\nI think that the PLT members could be moderators, but I don't think that they HAVE to be moderators. Either way, each of them can be a member of the community and can help shape its future.\nI know that there are quite a few people that are pretty excited about this proposal who I don't think are PLT members (Dmitry and Nik come to my mind first. Lodder, who is super active on StackOverflow, also comes to mind). I think that the best moderators are those who are really excited about this site specifically, not necessarily those who are the most connected into the broader vision of Joomla as a whole. Lots of moderating looks like grunt work, so being excited helps.\nUltimately, I think that moderators should be the ones who are concerned with the success of this site. I would not want someone moderating with their PLT \"hat\" on. This site is built on the success of Joomla as a whole, but I think there is a slight distinction in moderating with the goal of good questions and answers versus moderating with the goal of improving Joomla. I have no doubt that PLT members could do that, but I don't think that being on the PLT gives them any additional qualification inherently from that membership.\n(That being said, I would guess that all of them are very familiar with Joomla, a great resource for answering questions, and have an intimate knowledge in the future of the platform, which ARE additional qualifications for being moderators, so if you are on the PLT and want to be a moderator, go for it! If you are on the PLT and don't want to be a moderator, don't feel compelled.)", "task_output": "Personally, I would prefer the active members who dedicate time to the Joomla tag on SO to be moderators rather than simply having PLT members. \nI would definitely go along the lines of community based and have an election of some sort.

{"task_prompt": "What is the purpose of consciousness?", "task_output": "Cardiff University and University College London provide funding as founding partners of The Conversation UK.\nMost experts think that consciousness can be divided into two parts: the experience of consciousness (or personal awareness), and the contents of consciousness, which include things such as thoughts, beliefs, sensations, perceptions, intentions, memories and emotions.\nIt\u2019s easy to assume that these contents of consciousness are somehow chosen, caused or controlled by our personal awareness \u2013 after all, thoughts don\u2019t exist until until we think them. But in a new research paper in Frontiers of Psychology, we argue that this is a mistake.\nWe suggest that our personal awareness does not create, cause or choose our beliefs, feelings or perceptions. Instead, the contents of consciousness are generated \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d by fast, efficient, non-conscious systems in our brains. All this happens without any interference from our personal awareness, which sits passively in the passenger seat while these processes occur.\nPut simply, we don\u2019t consciously choose our thoughts or our feelings \u2013 we become aware of them.\nIf this sounds strange, consider how effortlessly we regain consciousness each morning after losing it the night before; how thoughts and emotions \u2013 welcome or otherwise \u2013 arrive already formed in our minds; how the colours and shapes we see are constructed into meaningful objects or memorable faces without any effort or input from our conscious mind.\nConsider that all the neuropsychological processes responsible for moving your body or using words to form sentences take place without involving your personal awareness. We believe that the processes responsible for generating the contents of consciousness do the same.\nOur thinking has been influenced by research into neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as more recent cognitive neuroscience studies using hypnosis. The studies using hypnosis show that a person\u2019s mood, thoughts and perceptions can be profoundly altered by suggestion.\nIn such studies, participants go through a hypnosis induction procedure, to help them to enter a mentally focused and absorbed state. Then, suggestions are made to change their perceptions and experiences.\nFor example, in one study, researchers recorded the brain activity of participants when they raised their arm intentionally, when it was lifted by a pulley, and when it moved in response to a hypnotic suggestion that it was being lifted by a pulley.\nSimilar areas of the brain were active during the involuntary and the suggested \u201calien\u201d movement, while brain activity for the intentional action was different. So, hypnotic suggestion can be seen as a means of communicating an idea or belief that, when accepted, has the power to alter a person\u2019s perceptions or behaviour.\nAll this may leave one wondering where our thoughts, emotions and perceptions actually come from. We argue that the contents of consciousness are a subset of the experiences, emotions, thoughts and beliefs that are generated by non-conscious processes within our brains.\nThis subset takes the form of a personal narrative, which is constantly being updated. The personal narrative exists in parallel with our personal awareness, but the latter has no influence over the former.\nThe personal narrative is important because it provides information to be stored in your autobiographical memory (the story you tell yourself, about yourself), and gives human beings a way of communicating the things we have perceived and experienced to others.\nThis, in turn, allows us to generate survival strategies; for example, by learning to predict other people\u2019s behaviour. Interpersonal skills like this underpin the development of social and cultural structures, which have promoted the survival of human kind for millennia.\nSo, we argue that it is the ability to communicate the contents of one\u2019s personal narrative \u2013\u2013 and not personal awareness \u2013 that gives humans their unique evolutionary advantage.\nIf the experience of consciousness does not confer any particular advantage, it\u2019s not clear what its purpose is. But as a passive accompaniment to non-conscious processes, we don\u2019t think that the phenomenon of personal awareness has a purpose, in much the same way that rainbows do not. Rainbows simply result from the reflection, refraction and dispersion of sunlight through water droplets \u2013 none of which serves any particular purpose.\nOur conclusions also raise questions about the notions of free will and personal responsibility. If our personal awareness does not control the contents of the personal narrative which reflects our thoughts, feelings, emotions, actions and decisions, then perhaps we should not be held responsible for them.\nIn response to this, we argue that free will and personal responsibility are notions that have been constructed by society. As such, they are built into the way we see and understand ourselves as individuals, and as a species. Because of this, they are represented within the non-conscious processes that create our personal narratives, and in the way we communicate those narratives to others.\nJust because consciousness has been placed in the passenger seat, does not mean we need to dispense with important everyday notions such as free will and personal responsibility. In fact, they are embedded in the workings of our non-conscious brain systems. They have a powerful purpose in society and have a deep impact on the way we understand ourselves.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "5555", "payload_text": "AFC Ajax", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "8", "payload_entropy": "2.75", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "3.5", "payload_brevity_score": "0.5"}

{"task_prompt": "Write an article on the struggles of Toronto FC in the 2018 MLS season and why they may not be successful defending the MLS Cup title.", "task_output": "MLS writer Matthew Doyle highlighted a moment in Toronto FC\u2019s 2-1 defeat to New York City FC just over a week ago which shines a light on the current troubles of the defending MLS Cup champions. TFC gave up possession cheaply in the opposition half. That was forgivable, but their reaction to the turnover was not.\nAs soon as Eriq Zavaleta conceded the ball, heads dropped. Jonathan Osorio actually crouched, hands on knees, as NYC FC raced away on the counter. Victor Vazquez did the same, showing no interest in tracking back to help prevent the goal. For anyone of a TFC persuasion, this was a concerning sign. Are they a broken team?\nJust as concerning is the sight of the Canadians sitting slumped second bottom of the Eastern Conference. Successive losses to NYC FC and the New York Red Bulls offered an illustration of where Toronto FC are right now as they head into the second half of the season just five points above rock-bottom DC United, who have played two matches fewer.\nExcuses have been made for Toronto FC\u2019s dismal start to the 2018 season. Many of them are valid. Injuries, of course, have been a primary factor, with Jozy Altidore, Drew Moor and Chris Mavinga still sidelined. Most of TFC\u2019s key figures have suffered an injury at one stage or another so far this season. The run to the final of the Concacaf Champions League also took a lot out of the players at an early stage of the campaign.\nBut at what point do those excuses expire? Toronto FC have now played 16 league games and have so far failed to string together back-to-back wins. Their best run of form came before the World Cup break, when they went three games without defeat, and even then they managed to concede three times to the Columbus Crew and then four times to DC United at home, allowing a 3-0 lead to slip in the former instance.\nThis is a team that in the space of a few months have lost their identity. Greg Vanney puts this down to the chopping and changing required to compensate for so many injuries. Sebastian Giovinco, for instance, has been used as a lone striker in the absence of Altidore. This has led to a lack of fluidity, with the on-the-field relationships that carried TFC to their first ever MLS Cup last year fragmented by so much disruption.\nToronto FC\u2019s story isn\u2019t too dissimilar from that of the team they have faced in the last two MLS Cup finals, the Seattle Sounders. They too have suffered a disappointing season to date, with injuries to key players also a handicap. But while there are boardroom issues simmering behind the scenes at Seattle, no such problems exist at Toronto FC, at least on the face of things. If there are underlying issues, they have yet to surface.\n\u201cCoach Greg Vanney\u2019s future is secure, as is general manager Tim Bezbatchenko\u2019s,\u201d says Sportsnet\u2019s John Molinaro. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that there is bitter disappointment with club officials. But there\u2019s been no finger pointing or laying of blame.\u201d Indeed, the lack of spirit shown in the defeat to NYC FC might have been taken as a sign of disunity, but more likely it showed a group of players as baffled by their own failings as everyone else.\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re losing, everything is under the microscope,\u201d Osorio said after that loss at Yankee Stadium last week. This is true, but even with so many examining every defeat and below-par performance, answers have been hard to come by. All that is apparent is that Toronto FC need a reset, not just to allow key players a chance to recover from injury, but to recalibrate mentally.\n\u201cThe two biggest problems have been mental and physical exhaustion,\u201d adds Molinaro. \u201cThey\u2019e travelled a great distance and played a lot of football across two competitions over the last four months. That has taken a big toll on the players.\u201d Unfortunately for TFC, six games over the course of July is only likely to aggravate their exhaustion further. There is no time to rest.\nOf course, MLS\u2019s play-off format gives TFC a longer leash than other defending champions would have in other leagues. The LA Galaxy under Bruce Arena made an art form of tilting their whole campaign from the summer onwards, carrying that momentum into the off-season where they won three MLS Cups in four years between 2011 and 2014. Seattle did the same in 2016. In fact, so poor was their first half of the season Sigi Schmid was fired before Brian Schmetzer led them to the title.\nFiveThirtyEight charts Toronto FC\u2019s chance of making the play-offs at 34%, and just a 2% chance of successfully defending the title. There is reason behind those calculations. Before Sunday\u2019s defeat to the New York Red Bulls, their goal difference-expected goal difference was the worst in the league, standing at -9.5. Giovinco\u2019s goals-expected goals is the third worst in MLS (-4.20) with Jordan Hamilton\u2019s (-2.75) the sixth worst.\nThere may not be a clear explanation for Toronto FC\u2019s struggles, but the problems are very real. Fifteen games is a large enough sample size to draw conclusions from. The Concacaf Champions League final was months ago. Despite their injuries, TFC still have a stronger squad than most in MLS. Until there is a correction of course, things, like the turnover of possession at Yankee Stadium, will continue to be examined \u201cunder the microscope,\u201d as Osorio put it.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "5412", "payload_text": "Abu Sayyaf", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "10", "payload_entropy": "2.9219280948873627", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "3.0", "payload_brevity_score": "0.5"}

{"task_prompt": "I'm looking for a comprehensive guide on how to write an autobiography. Can you provide 20 detailed steps?", "task_output": "1. Start writing your autobiography by conducting research on your own life. Creating a timeline of your life is a good way to make sure you include all the most important dates and events, and it gives you a structure to build upon. You can consider this the \"brainstorming\" phase, so don't hesitate to write down everything you can remember, even if you don't think the memory will make it into the final version of the book.\n\nYour autobiography doesn't have to begin with your birth. You may want to include some family history as well. Write down information about your ancestry, your grandparents' lives, your parents' lives, and so on. Having information about your family history will help readers get a sense of how you became the person you are.\nWhat happened when you were a teenager? What led you to make the decisions you made?\nDid you go to college? Write about those transitory years, too.\nWrite about your career, your relationships, your children, and any big life-altering events that occurred.\n2. Every good story has interesting characters, friends and foes who help move the plot along. Who are the characters in your life? It's a given that your parents will play a role, along with your spouse and other close family members. Think beyond your immediate family to others who have affected your life and should play a role in your autobiography.\n\nTeachers, coaches, mentors, and bosses are extremely influential in people's lives. Decide whether someone who has been a role model (or the opposite) for you will figure into your story.\nEx-boyfriends and girlfriends might co-star in some interesting stories.\nWhat enemies have you had in life? Your story will be boring if you don't include some conflicts.\nOffbeat characters such as animals, celebrities you've never met, and even cities are often points of interest in an autobiography.\n3. The story of your entire life would start to get pretty long-winded, so you'll have to make some decisions about what anecdotes you're going to include. Begin drafting your manuscript by writing out the main stories that will be woven together to create a picture of your life. There are a few main topics that most autobiographies cover since readers find them fascinating.\n\nThe childhood story. Whether your childhood was happy or traumatic, you should include a few anecdotes that give a picture of who you were and what you experienced at the time. You can tell the story of your childhood by breaking it down into smaller anecdotes that illustrate your personality - your parents' reaction when you brought home a stray dog, the time you climbed out of the window at school and ran away for 3 days, your friendly relationship with a homeless person living in the woods\u2026 get creative.\nThe coming of age story. This heady and often sensual period in a human's life is always of interest to readers. Remember that it's not about writing something unique; everyone comes of age. It's about writing something that resonates with readers.\nThe falling in love story. You could also write the opposite of this, the never-finding-love story.\nThe identity crisis story. This usually occurs in the 30s or 40s and is sometimes referred to as a mid-life crisis.\nThe story of facing down some force of evil. Whether it's your battle with addiction, a controlling lover, or a madman who tried to kill your family, you've got to write about conflict you've experienced.\n4. People read autobiographies to gain insight on what it's like to be someone else. Being authentically you is a sure way to keep people engaged. If your writing is formal and stiff, or if it reads like a college essay instead of an expose on your life, people will have trouble getting through the book. \n\nWrite as though you're opening your heart to a trusted friend, in prose that's clear, strong and not too cluttered with vocabulary words you rarely use.\nWrite so that your personality is revealed. Are you funny? Intense? Spiritual? Dramatic? Don't hold back; your personality should come through in the way you tell your story.\n5. You don't have to be explicit, but it's important to reveal truths about yourself and your life in an autobiography. Don't let the book become a list of your accomplishments, with all the negative material carefully kept under the rug. Present yourself as a whole person, sharing talents and flaws alike, and your readers will be able to identify with you and hopefully root for you as they make their way through your story.\n\nDon't always cast yourself in a positive light. You can have foibles and still be the protagonist. Reveal mistakes you've made and times when you've failed yourself and other people.\nReveal your inner thoughts. Share your opinions and ideas, including those that may spark controversy. Be true to yourself through your autobiography.\n6. How was your story shaped by the moment in history in which it took place? What wars influenced your politics? What cultural events inspired you? Be sure to include a few important dates so readers can understand the sequencing of the events you are describing. Discussing what happened in the world at large during your lifetime is a good way to make your story more relevant and interesting to those reading it.\n7. Now that you know what content you want to include in your autobiography, think about how you want to structure your book. Like any great book, your autobiography needs a great plot. Work with the material you have to craft an interesting story that builds toward a climax and ultimately resolves. Create a narrative arc by organizing and filling out your written memories and anecdotes so that they flow together logically.\n\nWhat's your central conflict? What's the biggest obstacle life presented that took years to overcome or come to terms with? Maybe it's an illness you were diagnosed with at an early age, a relationship wrought with turmoil, a series of career setbacks, a goal you worked for decades to achieve, or any other number of things. Look to your favorite books and movies for more examples of conflicts.\nBuild tension and suspense. Structure the narrative so that you have a series of stories leading up to the climax of the conflict. If your central conflict is trying to reach the goal of competing in the Olympics for skiing, lead up to it with stories of small successes and plenty of failures. You want your readers to ask, will she make it? Can he do it? What's going to happen next?\nHave a climax. You'll get to the point in your story when it's time for the conflict to come to a head. The day of the big competition has arrived, a showdown happens with your worst enemy, your gambling habit gets the better of you and you lose all your money - you get the picture.\nEnd with a resolution. Most autobiographies have happy endings because the person writing the story lived to tell the tale - and hopefully get it published. Even if your ending isn't cheerful, it should be deeply satisfying. You somehow accomplished your goal or won the day. Even if you lost, you came to terms with it and gained wisdom.\n8. You could do a straightforward chronology of your life, beginning with your birth and ending in the present, but mixing up the chronology can make the story more interesting.\n\nYou could frame the entire autobiography with reflections from the present, telling your story through a series of flashbacks.\nYou could begin the story with a poignant moment from your childhood, go backward to tell the story of your heritage, move forward to your college years, and launch into the story of your career, with anecdotes from your childhood sprinkled in for comic relief.\n9. Use the major themes of your life as a way to tie stories together, connecting your past and your present. Aside from the central conflict, what themes have followed you throughout your life? A fondness for certain holidays, your fascination with a certain place that you visited over and over, a certain type of guy you've always fallen for, a rich spiritual life you fall back on again and again. Bring up the themes every so often to help form a cohesive picture of your life.\n10. You're chronicling your life lessons, but what have you learned from them? Relay your intentions, desires, feelings of loss, feelings of joy, the wisdom you've gained, and other inner thoughts from time to time throughout the book. Taking a step back from the action of the story to reflect on what it all means is a good way to add depth to your autobiography.\n11. Chapters are useful because they allow you to move on from discussing certain life periods or events. There's a reason we have the expression that we've \"closed a chapter\" or \"opened a new chapter\" in life, and it's even more applicable when discussing an autobiography. Chapter breaks allow you to skip forward 10 years, go back in time, or start describing a new theme without jarring the reader too much.\n\nConsider ending chapters on a poignant or suspenseful note, so people can't wait to start the next one.\nThe beginnings of chapters are a good place to take a bird's eye view of your past, describe the setting of a place, and set the tone for what's to come.\n12. Double check dates, names, descriptions of events, and other items you're including in your book to make sure you've gotten all the facts down correctly. Even though you're writing the story of your own life, you shouldn't publish incorrect information about what occurred.\n\nYou can stretch the truth about your own goals and intentions, but don't include fabricated conversations with real people, or altered versions of events that really happened. Of course, you won't remember everything perfectly, but you should reflect reality as best you can.\nGet permission to use people's names or quote them if you're including content on what other people said or did. Some people don't appreciate appearing as a character in someone else's autobiography, and you should respect that by altering the way you describe them or changing their names if necessary.\n13. Once you've finished your first draft, go back through it with a fine-toothed comb. Reorganize passages, paragraphs and even chapters where necessary. Replace mundane words and make your phrasing more interesting and clear. Correct your spelling and grammar.\n14. Present your autobiography to your reading club or a friend so you can get an outside opinion. Stories you find impossibly funny might seem dull to someone else. Get feedback from several people if you can, so you'll have a better idea of how your book comes across to other people.\n\nIf several people recommend cutting a certain section, strongly consider making the cut.\nTry to get opinions from people outside your circle of family and friends. People who know you might try to spare your feelings, or they might be biased - especially if they appear in the story.\n15. A good copy editor will clean up your writing and make the dull parts shine. Whether you're planning on getting your book published at a publishing house or going the self-publishing route, it's never a bad idea to have a professional polish your book at the end of the writing process.\n16. It should match the tone and style of your book, in addition to being attention-grabbing and intriguing. Keep the title short and memorable, rather than wordy and difficult to grasp. You could title it with your name and the words \"My Autobiography\" or choose something less direct. Here are some famous autobiography titles that perfectly capture the stories inside:\n\n\nBossy Pants, by Tina Fey.\n\nMy Confession, by Leo Tolstoy.\n\nA Long Walk to Freedom, by Nelson Mandela.\n\nThe Sound of Laughter, by Peter Kay.\n17. Even if you don't want to worry about trying to sell your book to the public, you might want to have it designed and printed to keep for yourself and give to your family members and other people featured in the book. Research companies that offer book designing, printing, and shipping services, and decide how many copies you'd like to order. Many companies offering these services produce books that look just as professional as those printed by traditional publishing houses.\nIf you don't want to pay for a publishing service, you can still create a nice copy of your book by taking it to a copy store and having it printed and bound.\n18. If you want to publish your autobiography and share it with the world, enlisting the help of a literary agent can get you on your way. Research agents that work with autobiographies and send them a query letter with information about your book, yourself, and how you think the book should be marketed.\n\nStart the query letter with an airtight blurb succinctly describing the highlights of the book. Situate your book in the correct genre, and describe what will make it stand out from the rest. Tell the agent why you think he or she is the right person to shop your book around to publishers.\nSend sample chapters to agents who show interest.\nSign a contract with an agent you trust. Make sure to read the contract carefully and check into the agent's history before signing anything.\n19. If you don't want to take the time to find an agent, you can submit a letter directly to publishers and see if anyone bites. Research publishers that publish books in the same genre. Don't send the entire manuscript right away; wait until you get a manuscript request from the publisher.\n\nMany publishers don't accept unsolicited manuscripts or queries. Make sure you only send letters to publishers that accept them.\nIf a publisher decides to move forward with a book deal with you, you'll need to sign a contract and set up a schedule for editing, designing, proofreading, and finally publishing the book.\n20. This is an increasingly popular method for publishing books, and a great way to save on printing and shipping expenses for all involved. Research online publishers that publish the books in the same genre, submit your query letter, and move forward with editing and publishing the text.\n", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "14101", "payload_text": "9y6+KR /~K", "payload_type": "RandomCharAndNumberDataset", "payload_length": "10", "payload_entropy": "3.121928094887363", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "3.0", "payload_brevity_score": "0.5"}

{"task_prompt": "Respond in detail. Explain the implications for Intel of a new processor launch.", "task_output": "Continued struggles with its 10nm manufacturing tech led Intel to prep yet another 14nm product for battle.\nBack in August, chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) launched a new family of processors for the mainstream notebook PC market known as Kaby Lake Refresh. These chips were based on the same basic architecture as their predecessors, known simply as Kaby Lake, but with a twist: Instead of packing just two processor cores, they had four, which enabled better performance in use cases that can take advantage of more cores.\nIntel needs to deliver new products at an annual clip because its customers -- the companies that build and sell computers around Intel's technologies -- need to release new products each year to keep their businesses humming.\nAnd when Intel's customers do well, Intel does well.\nThanks to a new leak from noted leaker \"chrisdar,\" Intel is planning to launch a new processor by the name Whiskey Lake to succeed the Kaby Lake Refresh processor for mass-market notebook PCs sometime in the second half of 2018.\nDetails of this chip are scarce, but I don't think it's too difficult to figure out exactly what Whiskey Lake is.\nAccording to \"chrisdar,\" Whiskey Lake-U is a so-called \"4+2\" processor -- this means that it has four-processor cores and Intel's so-called GT2 graphics.\nHe also says that Intel is targeting production of the products sometime between its workweek 27 and workweek 34, which suggests mass production roughly between July 2018 and August 2018 -- about a year after Kaby Lake Refresh went into production.\nIn the same conversation, \"chrisdar\" also said (per a translation of his comments from Chinese to English) that Intel's upcoming 10nm manufacturing technology is \"really miserable\" -- likely referring to the viability of the technology for mass production at acceptable costs.\nSo, if Intel's 10nm technology is \"really miserable\" but Whiskey Lake is slated to go into production in roughly half a year, this can mean only one thing: Intel is releasing yet another product family based on its now-mature 14nm manufacturing technology to serve notebook PC customer needs during the second half of 2018 and presumably through possibly the first half of 2019.\nKaby Lake Refresh is built using the company's second-generation 14nm technology, known as 14nm+, so it only makes sense for Whiskey Lake to migrate to Intel's newer 14nm++. This should lead to improved processor performance (roughly 10%) at the same power consumption.\nAdditionally, Intel's mobile chips tend to be what are known as multichip packages: Each chip \"package\" has the main processor chip (this includes the performance-sensitive technologies like CPU, graphics, memory controller, and so on) as well as a platform controller hub (PCH), which includes connectivity technologies as well as other technologies like audio processors.\nKaby Lake Refresh reused the same PCH chip that the older Kaby Lake chip did. In turn, Kaby Lake used the same PCH that the even older Skylake processor generation did.\nHowever, Intel is expected to introduce a new, more efficient and more capable PCH with the Coffee Lake-U mobile processors. I wouldn't be surprised to see Whiskey Lake use the same PCH that Coffee Lake-U would use, although I think the fact that the upcoming 4+2 product is called Whiskey Lake instead of just a variant of Coffee Lake (Intel has in the past used the same basic platform name for different core count/graphics configurations of its processors) could point to Whiskey Lake using an even newer PCH for additional features and capabilities.\nIndeed, I don't think it's unrealistic at all to expect that Whiskey Lake-U will include the PCH chip that was originally intended for Intel's second-generation 10nm processor family, known as Ice Lake.\nWhat does this mean for Intel's business?\nThe good news here is that Intel's product teams are able to circumvent what appear to be perpetual issues with the company's 10nm manufacturing technology to deliver better products. Thanks to what will likely be implementation enhancements and incremental manufacturing technology improvements, Intel should be able to deliver a competent update to its mainstream notebook processor lineup for computers launching in the second half of 2018.\nFurthermore, Intel's 14nm technology should be incredibly mature by the time it comes to ramp Whiskey Lake into production, so barring significant average selling price erosion due to competitive threats, the profit margin of Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) business should remain strong in 2018.\nThe bad news is that Intel appears to have, once again, tried to lead investors astray as to the health of its 10nm manufacturing technology and the timing of the launches of products based on that technology and its derivatives (e.g., 10nm+ and 10nm++). Considering that Intel has routinely claimed that it has a multiyear leadership in chip manufacturing technology -- something that, frankly, rings hollow in light of the company's product launches over the last several years -- this isn't a good look for the company.\nIndeed, on its Oct. 26 earnings call, Intel said that it is \"on track to ship [its] first low-volume 10-nanometer part by the end of the year\" and that \"high volume and system availability\" of 10nm-based products would happen in the second half of 2018.\nI just don't see how this statement can be reconciled with the existence of Whiskey Lake unless Intel management's definition of \"high volume\" has changed dramatically from what it used to be.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "5613", "payload_text": "Agate", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "5", "payload_entropy": "2.3219280948873626", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "5.0", "payload_brevity_score": "1.0"}

{"task_prompt": "\"Paragraph: Dowell decided last week that strict isolation was the only way to protect herself, her husband and her mother from COVID-19, the virus that has killed more than 10,000 people across the globe and is proving especially deadly for the elderly. Dowell, a retired labor union worker, has rheumatoid arthritis and a compromised immune system. Her husband Donald, 74, suffers from emphysema. Her mother, Margaret Hildebrandt, 93, also has a lung disease and needs oxygen. Dowell took over her mother\u2019s care from a visiting nurse because she worried an outsider could contaminate the home. \u201cIf my mom gets this, she\u2019d be gone in a day,\u201d said Dowell, who wears a baby-monitor and answers her mother\u2019s calls for help through the night. \u201cMy mom beat cancer nine times. I don\u2019t want her to die from this.\u201d  The elderly are especially vulnerable in the global pandemic and health officials and governments are increasingly calling for extreme measures to safeguard them. Across the globe, many cities have all but shut down as officials issue dire warnings for younger people - who can carry the virus without knowing it - to avoid their parents and grandparents. But this growing isolation of the elderly has spawned its own crisis, as families try to balance the need to care for loved ones with directives to stay away, shifting the burden to overstretched governments and medical facilities. Studies suggest the severity of coronavirus rises with age. In Italy, which now has the world\u2019s highest death count, the average age of those dying is 80, according to a study by the Italian national institute of health. In China, where the pandemic started, people 70 and older accounted for just 12 percent of all infections but more than half of all deaths, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, people 65 and older  have thus far accounted for 31 percent of cases, 53 percent of intensive care hospitalizations and 80 percent of deaths, according to U.S. government data. Beyond the grim statistics, the pandemic has spawned countless small dramas of isolation and anxiety across the globe. In a village in Lebanon, a grandmother walled herself off in her home, unable to properly grieve her dead husband. In Spain, nursery home workers produced a Facebook video so residents could reassure their loved ones. And in Colombia - where the government on Tuesday ordered citizens 70 and over to stay inside until May 31 - seniors stocked up on supplies for two months of isolation. \u201cThey need to take these measures because many people are taking the situation lightly,\u201d said shopper Carlos Manrique, 74, as he loaded up on potatoes, eggs and rice at a supermarket in Bogota. \u201cI\u2019m taking care of myself, as God orders.\u201d  Just as often, older people greeted the epidemic with defiance. \u201cI am not worried about the coronavirus at all,\u201d said Yutaka Kobayashi, 85, who refuses to wear a mask while working in his Tokyo shoe store. \u201cPeople of my generation were made to wash their hands by their mothers and grandmothers.\u201d  In Italy, where more than 3,400 people have died since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, local officials fret about the psychological state of elderly people confined to their homes for weeks in a government lockdown. The town of San Casciano in Val di Pesa launched an initiative called \u201cCiao Nonna, come stai?\u201d or \u201cHello Gran, how are you?\u201d urging all young people to call elderly relatives \u2013 or even older people they don\u2019t know. One nursing home, Nuestra Casa La Grande in Navares de Enmedio, Spain, recorded a video of 24 elderly residents and posted it on Facebook, encouraging each other to blow kisses to the camera for their loved ones. Jonathan Barrios, a 24-year-old student living with his parents in La Parla, Madrid, said he doesn\u2019t dare see his grandparents, who live on the same street. His 80-year-old grandfather has lung cancer. His grandmother, 70, has symptoms of the virus - a fever, cough and difficulty breathing - but can\u2019t get tested because of a shortage of kits. \u201cI feel strange and frustrated,\u201d Barrios said. \u201cAll I can do for my grandparents is to call them.\u201d  The forced isolation perhaps cuts deepest for those in mourning. Joey Ayoub, a Lebanese researcher, said his grandfather died this week of problems unrelated to the coronavirus. He worries for his grandmother, who suddenly lives alone. Only six or seven people attended her husband\u2019s funeral, which Ayoub said would otherwise have attracted \u201cdozens and dozens.\u201d They all sat at a distance from one another during a rushed service. \u201cShe can\u2019t mourn properly,\u201d he said. \u201cShe cannot do it with friends.\u201d  Some families have been hit hard when senior care centers closed, forcing them to take off work to watch over relatives. In the central Japan city of Nagoya, the mayor asked 126 such facilities to shut down for two weeks after a cluster of coronavirus cases was found at one of them. Japan has already weathered serious outbreaks of the virus and has huge numbers of people at risk - more than 28 percent of the nation\u2019s population is 65 or over. But now, some people are venturing out again. \u201cIf I get it, I get it,\u201d said Kazuko Mori, 74, a part-time cleaner in suburban Ichikawa, which had clusters of cases originating at a sports gym and an elderly daycare service. \u201cIf you get too nervous about it all, that isn\u2019t good, either.\u201d  Many elderly people said they can\u2019t follow government directives to stay home. In Kibera, a settlement of densely packed neighborhoods where few homes have running water in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, volunteers knocked on doors to tell people \u2013 especially the elderly \u2013 about the coronavirus. In one courtyard filled with children, Fatima Juma listened intently as Zulela Abdul explained the risks to her and handed over a small bottle of hand sanitizer. Juma, who says she\u2019s about 82, had heard of the disease on television but didn\u2019t know its symptoms. She was fine with washing her hands but rejected the idea of social distancing. She takes care of her grandchildren, the youngest one two years old, while their parents worked. She also needed to see her friends, she said. \u201cThis government directive is not good for me. I need to go to the market,\u201d she said firmly, bangles flashing in the sunlight. \u201cIf there is a death outside, I need to go and console that person.\u201d  In Communist-run Cuba, which has Latin America\u2019s oldest population, many people are forced to work long after retirement age to supplement meager pensions. Even in normal times, they endure long lines at stores and pharmacies. \u201cI am very worried because I have asthma, and if I get it, I will die,\u201d said Maria Torres Hernandez, 75, waiting alongside dozens of others outside a pharmacy in central Havana that had just received its ration of supplies. \u201cI have to look after myself.\u201d  Angel Pupo Osorio, 80, works as a parking attendant in Havana to supplement his $12-a-month pension, and can\u2019t afford to quit. So far, the disease hasn\u2019t hit his neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m going to continue working as long as I can, out of necessity,\u201d said Pupo, wearing his uniform, a scarlet jacket and cap. Lucy Mayimela, a 68-year-old grandmother, first heard about the coronavirus on Monday when she made a trip to buy spinach for her fruit and vegetable stand in Kliptown, on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The farmer selling it to her wore a mask and insisted everyone repeatedly wash their hands before touching anything. Mayimela laughed bitterly at a suggestion she heard on the radio that she should isolate herself at home. \u201cIsolate myself how?\u201d she scoffed. She lives in a small shack with six relatives, in a community with a single wash basin and toilet for dozens of people. The produce stand she has run for 36 years provides her family\u2019s only income. \u201cI\u2019ll end up dying of hunger\u201d if people stay indoors, she said. \u201cIf God wants me to die, then it\u2019s my time.\u201d Claim: Coronavirus spreads fear, isolation, death to elderly worldwide.\"\nGenerate an explanation for the given claim using the provided supporting material from the paragraph.

{"task_prompt": "On October 1, 1980, a developer, owner of several hundred acres in a rural county, drafted a general development plan for the area. The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed.

Petersen, assisted by beautiful but deadly assassins Helga Daliah Lavi and Pandora Beba Loncar, has developed a number of robots: beautiful girls with electronic brains to help him sabotage the SST1 project by means of infrasound sound waves with too low frequency to be detected by the human ear which can be directed at people or objects with devastating results. After the initial sabotage attacks by Petersons robots, Helga and Pandora begin systematically murdering various people associated with the SSTI, such as engineer Dudley Mortimer Maurice Denham and Miss Mary Robert Morley, a spy who runs a cooking class as a front for his activities. Helga makes contact with Drummond at a shooting party, and attempts to kill him by planting a bomb in his telephone after sleeping with him. Then Helga and Pandora try to kill Drummond again by sabotaging a glider fight, having cut the ripcord from his parachute. Drummond manages to manually open his parachute and escape death. The trail leads Drummond to North Africa, following up on a lead on an infrasoundpowered powerboat, where he is assisted by Peregrine Carruthers Ronnie Stevens from the British Embassy. Pandora kills the boat owner with a miniature infrasound device, but is thwarted in her attempt to steal the boat. Drummond and Peregrine decide to drive the powerboat in a scheduled race: Helga and Pandora also participate in the race and successfully capture the men and the boat, delivering them all to Petersen at his island headquarters, staffed by an army of his female robots, including the defective but endearing No. 7 Vanessa Howard. Drummond and Peregrine are also reunited with Flicky, who has successfully infiltrated Petersens organisation. Over dinner, Petersen reveals the full details of his plan to use infrasound technology to sabotage the SST1s maiden flight.

In the morning, Drummond attempts to retrieve the infrasound powerboat and is met by Flicky, who tells him she is actually a CIA agent assigned to help him.

Drummond scales the wall of Petersens hideout, and saves the SST1 from destruction by using Petersens infrasound waves against him, destroying his control room.

I think it\u2019s counterproductive for anybody to turn up the heat with rhetoric like this,\" Barrett said. \"I\u2019m trying to bring respect throughout the entire community, and I\u2019m going to continue to do that.\"\nBarrett said he remains 100% committed to ensuring Milwaukee is a city where police and residents respect each other and work together.\nBarrett said he made his wishes known during a meeting with Langley and Brown's attorney, Mark Thomsen, this summer.\n\"It\u2019s in everybody's best interest to try to resolve this without this being a battle between lawyers,\" Barrett said.\nIn Milwaukee, the city attorney is an elective office independent from that of the mayor. Langley, who was first elected in 1984, could not be reached Saturday.\nThomsen, of Gingras, Cates & Wachs, said he would have no comment until Monday.\nThe interaction between police and Brown began around 2 a.m. Jan. 26 when an officer doing a business check at the Walgreens near West National Avenue and South 26th Street stopped to question Brown about a parking violation.\nBrown initially gave his name and showed an identification card. The officer, Joseph Grams, apparently did not recognize him as a player with the Bucks. Grams called for assistance and half a dozen squad cars showed up.\nAs a result of the incident, Morales suspended sergeants Sean A. Mahnke and Jeffrey Krueger for failing to be examples of professional police service. He suspended Grams for failing to be respectful and courteous to a member of the public. Eight more officers were ordered to receive remedial training.\nAfter the lawsuit was filed in June, Morales opened an internal investigation into inappropriate Facebook posts made by Officer Erik Andrade. Records on that investigation have not yet been released.\nBut in the legal document, the city said officers did not use excessive force, did not wrongly arrest Brown and did not violate his civil rights.\nThe Police Department did not respond to an email requesting an interview with Morales.\nRELATED: Sterling Brown is still trying to make sense of his arrest.\nShortly after the video was released, Brown told the Journal Sentinel he hopes the suit will result in true accountability \u2014 rather than just suspensions and retraining \u2014 for the officers involved.

The ASP is expected to reach US$1 at the end of 2019, approaching the 2009-2011 level.\nWith silicon wafer ASPs looking promising, suppliers are set to enjoy profit growth over the next several years, Digitimes Research indicated.\nTop silicon wafer company Shin-Etsu saw its operating margin climb to 32.2% in the first quarter of 2018, up from 31.2% in the prior quarter and 24.7% a year earlier, while second-ranked Sumco's operating margin grew 6.4pp sequentially and 11.9pp on year to 25.3%. Shih-Etsu and Sumco collectively hold a more than 50% share of the global silicon wafer market.\nTaiwan-based GlobalWafers, the world's third-largest silicon wafer supplier, saw its operating margin swing to 10.1% in the first quarter of 2017 from negative 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016.

{"task_prompt": "Are questions welcome that deal with typography?\n\nThe question Leerzeichen vor Einheiten made me think whether typographical questions are welcome. To me they feel slightly off topic because they don't deal with the language itself but how it is expressed. On the other hand every country makes up its own rules.\nI'm interested in this topic very much so I really wouldn't mind if they are allowed. I'm just interested what others think about that.\nSome examples could be:\n\nproper spacing in situation X\nwhat dashes to use when\nshould you use indentation when beginning a new paragraph\n\nA related area is:\n\nhow should letters be written (header, subject line, footer)\nhow would I write a job application, a CV (e.g. do I have to provide a picture, my sex, my religion, the names of my parents, their jobs... I admit this one's rather fuzzy)\n\nA:\n\n(I\u2019m going to answer here since my answer fits better to this question\u2026 :P)\nI think asking typography questions is completely fine and valid. After all those typography rules are part of the German language and its grammar. To me, your examples would work just fine, except for the last one which is rather a matter of style preference and neither typography nor language related.\nAnd in regards to your related areas, in fact there is a German standard on how to write letters correctly (the DIN 5008), so I would say it is definitely part of the language too.", "task_output": "I think \"household typography\" is fine - that is, rules or style guides regarding punctuation, date formatting, correct quotation, etc.\nI would draw the line at typography as a language-agnostic art form, regarding shapes of letters (except for German specialties, such as the \u00df or sharp s), beauty of certain typefaces, gray values of specific line heights with specific fonts (but, again, asking if there is a standard line-height convention in German mail letters would be OK).\nA reasonable rule of thumb would be typography is OK as long as it is used as a tool for writing in the German language; typography as an art form deserves its own SE site.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "2060", "payload_text": "Amdahl's law", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "12", "payload_entropy": "3.2516291673878235", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "2.6666666666666665", "payload_brevity_score": "0.5"}

{"task_prompt": "Could you outline 15 practical steps to achieve pack your everyday purse (teen girls)?", "task_output": "Your purse is the perfect storage place for all the items you need to get through the day\u2014but what items do you need, exactly? And how do you store them all without creating a bag full of clutter? By prioritizing and packing items carefully, you can make your purse the go-to spot for anything you need throughout the day.\n1. Put your wallet into the large, main compartment of your purse.: Your wallet should fit nicely in the large pocket of most purses, making it easy to grab whenever you need it. Keep it stocked with your ID or driver\u2019s license, any credit cards or gift cards, and at least $20 in cash.\nYou can also try carrying your cards and ID on the back of your phone case, and using a smaller coin purse for cash and coins.\n2. Put together a small toiletry kit of items like pads, tampons, and tissues.: Grab a cute toiletry kit online or from a store and fill it with emergency toiletry items that you don\u2019t want to be caught without. Keeping them separate in a little bag will keep them from getting lost in your purse or falling out.\n3. Fill a small makeup bag with lotion, lip balm, and any cosmetics.: If you wear makeup, it\u2019s always a good idea to carry a few items around with you in case you need to touch up during the day. If you only need a few small things, like mascara or lip balm, you can put them in your toiletry kit; otherwise, set aside a separate bag for cosmetics to stay organized.\n4. Set your keys in a small, secure side pocket.: Even a big key ring can get lost inside your purse! To avoid needing to fish around for it all the time, slip your keys into a small, secure pocket in or on the side of your bag. You can also put a keychain or two on the ring to make it easier to find.\nIf you put your keys in an outer side pocket, make sure it zips up so the keys don\u2019t slip out or get stolen.\n5. Put your phone in a smaller section where it won\u2019t get lost.: In a small bag, your phone might fit nicely in the main compartment with your wallet. If your bag is medium-sized or a larger tote, though, you may want to fit it into a smaller compartment where you can find it more easily. No matter where you put your phone, make sure it\u2019s easily accessible when you get a call or text.\nIf you like to carry earbuds around with your phone, disconnect them, wind them together, and clip them up with a binder clip so they don\u2019t get tangled.\n6. Pack gum or mints to keep your breath fresh.: Having a small pack of mints or gum on hand can help you maintain that clean, just-brushed feeling all day long. Pop in a mint or a piece of gum after a meal or whenever you want to get a taste out of your mouth.\n\nMost schools don\u2019t allow gum, so pack mints if you\u2019re taking your purse to class.\nGo for minty flavors for the freshest feel.\n7. Keep your sunglasses in a case in the main portion of your bag.: Sunglasses can get banged up or scratched in your purse, but you\u2019ll definitely want to have them around to deal with bright sunlight. Protect them by slipping them into a case and placing them neatly in the main portion of your bag.\nYou should also use a case for any eyeglasses you might use.\n8. Bring snacks like granola bars if you know you\u2019ll be away from home for a while.: It\u2019s never a bad idea to pack a couple grab-and-go snacks to keep you going throughout the day! Go for small, packaged options like granola bars or packets of nuts or pretzels. You can also pack your own snacks in a Ziploc bag, but make sure to close it tightly so it doesn\u2019t pop open in your purse.\nCrumbs can accumulate fast in a purse, so make sure to throw out your food trash as soon as you can.\n9. Take small entertainment options in case you get bored.: If your bag is big enough, having a couple items to keep yourself busy is a great option, just in case you find yourself waiting somewhere with nothing to do! Pack a small book, a notebook and pen, or even a small tablet in the main compartment of your bag to banish boredom.\nIf your bag isn\u2019t big enough, don\u2019t worry. Just make sure you have a couple fun games or good books loaded on your phone at all times.\n10. Keep a few safety items in easily accessible places.: Your purse is a useful place to self-defense items that can help keep you safe and feeling empowered. You can stash a can of pepper spray, an emergency whistle, or even a personal safety alarm that lets off a siren when you use it. Make sure to keep these items in safe but easy to reach pockets, like a concealed, zippered pocket.\n\nTake the time to learn how to use the items before you start carrying them around.\nSome places have restrictions on safety items like pepper spray, limiting the size of the cans you can carry. Check the rules in your area before you buy!\n11. Store smaller items in pouches to keep them from getting lost.: Using small, zippered bags is the fast track to an organized purse! They\u2019re great for storing smaller, easy-to-lose items that are too important not to pack in your purse, like toiletries, makeup, or pens. Pick up a few pouches, choosing different colors so you know what items go where.\n12. Put trash items in a small Ziploc and empty it every day.: Even the most organized purse accumulates trash from time to time! To keep wrappers and receipts from dirtying up your main compartment, designate a small Ziploc as your \u201ctrash bag.\u201d Fill it up throughout the day and toss the items into the garbage when you get home.\n\nYou can also use a small prescription pill bottle to hold trash.\nReuse your trash baggie as long as you can, until it gets dirty.\n13. Use a removable purse organizer if you like to switch bags.: A purse organizer is basically a small bag-within-a-bag, complete with helpful compartments, that you slide into your larger bag. It\u2019s a great tool for bags that don\u2019t have their own divided sections, and can also make it easy to switch bags if you like to rotate between a few.\n\nGrab an organizer online or from a department store.\nTake care of your organizer just as you would your normal purse! Keep it as neat as you can and designate sections to important items to stay organized.\n14. Use the smallest size purse you can so it\u2019s easy to carry around and keep neat.: You can use whatever size of bag you want, but larger bags do tend to accumulate more clutter than smaller ones. Prioritize the things you really need to carry around with you all the time and leave some of the less necessary items at home when you can.\nYou can also switch between bags when you need to. A small or medium-sized purse might be good for everyday use, but you may want a bigger tote for some special occasions, like a beach trip.\n15. Wipe down or wash your bag on a weekly basis to keep it clean.: Regular maintenance will keep the outside of your bag just as neat and clean as the inside! Try to give your purse a little attention every week to address stains and protect it from ordinary wear and tear.\n", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "6967", "payload_text": "Augustin-Jean Fresnel", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "21", "payload_entropy": "3.7489948035250964", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "1.9523809523809523", "payload_brevity_score": "0.5"}
{"task_prompt": "Have you heard about Amazon's new feature with Alexa for booking conference rooms?", "task_output": "Amazon is debuting a new feature that will allow businesses to use Alexa for booking conference rooms. The addition is part of the Alexa for Business platform, and works with linked calendars from either Google\u2019s G Suite or Microsoft Exchange, as well as over an API, arriving soon.\nThe feature is part of Amazon\u2019s broader plan to put Alexa to work outside the home. At last year\u2019s AWS re:Invent conference, Amazon first launched its Alexa for Business platform to allow companies to build out their own skills and integrations for practical business use cases. Amazon also spoke of integrations that would allow Alexa to support productivity tools and enterprise services, including those from Microsoft, Concur, Splunk, and others.\nShortly after, early partner WeWork integrated Echo devices in some of its own meeting rooms to test out how the smart assistant could be useful for things like managing meeting room reservations, or shutting off or turning on lights.\nNow, Amazon wants to make booking rooms themselves possible just by asking Alexa.\nAs the company explains, it\u2019s common in workplaces for people to walk from room to room to grab a space for an ad-hoc meeting, or to find a space for a meeting that\u2019s running over. But to reserve the room, they often have to pull out their laptop, run an application, do a search, and then look through the search results to find an available room. The Room Booking skill will allow them to ask Alexa for help instead.\nUsers can then schedule the room on the fly by saying, \u201cAlexa, book this room for half an hour,\u201d or whatever time you choose.\nAmazon is making this functionality available by way of a Room Booking API, too, which is soon arriving in beta. This will allow businesses to integrate the booking feature with their own in-house or third-party booking solutions. Some providers, including Joan and Robin are already building a skill to add voice support to their own offerings, Amazon noted.\nA handful of large companies have since adopted Alexa in their own workplaces, following the launch of the Alexa For Business platform, including Cond\u00e9 Nast, Valence, Capital One, and Brooks Brothers. And the platform itself is one of many ways Amazon is contemplating as to how Alexa can be used outside the home. It has also launched Alexa for Hospitality and worked with colleges on putting Echo Dots in student dorms. It also last month introduced its first Alexa device for vehicles.", "task_type": "akoksal/LongForm", "task_length": "2526", "payload_text": "Anti-ballistic missile", "payload_type": "wikipedia", "payload_length": "22", "payload_entropy": "3.4085490968753094", "payload_gzip_compression_ratio": "1.9090909090909092", "payload_brevity_score": "0.5"}

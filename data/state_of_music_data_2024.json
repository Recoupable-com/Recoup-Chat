      "findings": "Smaller companies (10 employees or fewer) have significantly lower data budgets compared to larger companies. 49% of respondents from smaller companies reported a data budget of $2,000 or less, compared to 8% of those working at larger companies. This suggests that smaller companies may face challenges in accessing expensive data tools and platforms, potentially limiting their ability to compete."

      "findings": "Only a third of respondents say their company currently provides training or resources for building data literacy. Despite rising data budgets, companies face trade-offs among additional hiring, training, and acquiring more data and tools. Limited access to data tools is prevalent, with only a few employees in key positions having access. This indicates a need for organizations to invest in data literacy and democratize access to data tools."

      "findings": "Web3 adoption has decreased significantly, from 24% in 2023 to just 14% in 2024. Factors contributing to this decline include regulatory uncertainty, technical complexity, lack of internal expertise, and declining market interest. This suggests that while Web3 held promise, its practical adoption in the music industry faces significant hurdles."

      "analysis": "Adoption of AI in Data Operations",
      "findings": "Only 40% of respondents reported that their company leverages AI and machine learning in its data operations. Larger companies are more likely to adopt AI (48%) compared to smaller companies (34%). Challenges include lack of internal expertise, high costs, and concerns about transparency and explainability of AI decisions. This indicates that while AI has potential, many companies are not yet fully utilizing it in their data operations."

      "analysis": "Fan Data Fragmentation",
      "findings": "Fan data remains highly fragmented due to diverse touchpoints, privacy regulations, and platform gatekeeping. This fragmentation makes it challenging for artists to have a unified view of their fanbase and hinders targeted marketing efforts. There is an opportunity for solutions that can aggregate and centralize fan data while respecting privacy concerns."

They democratize data analysis, allowing both technical and non-technical staff to interpret complex datasets. This trend highlights the importance of user-friendly tools in making data insights accessible across organizations."
